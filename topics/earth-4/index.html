			<div class="topic-info"><br>Earth 4 is a planet located on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth 3, as well as from Earth 5. It is an entirely desertous planet, having no oceans and being almost entirely devoid of rain, surface water, and non-human life. The planet has an increasing human population on average of 5 billion people, however this number fluctuates greatly from day to day. Despite the large population, there are no inhabited civilizations on Earth 4. There is only one address on Earth 4 which interglobal shipping standards currently recognizes, known as Phillip's House and is the permanent residence of Phillip Ball. The planet has no economy, infastructure, ecosystems, agriculture, transportation system, or formal governing body.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Called "Phillip's World" by some, this planet has been the residence of Phillip Ball since August 2021. Since that date, Phillip has acted as the de facto ruler over the planet, whose population has routinely followed his orders since Phillip's arrival.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Before this, Earth 4 was widely considered a prosperous and advance planet, having the highest global GDP and exports of raw and processed resources. Earth 4 was also known for its technological and cultural exports which had a profound impact on all Earths. The planet was the first to establish contact with other Earths in 1939 when Earth 4 explorers translated to the cities of Earth 5. Since then, Earth 4 has been an important trade hub due to its position and advance interglobal-transportation technology and infastructure. In the transglobal economy, many considered the planet essential.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Upon Phillip's arrival and establishment of control, he undertook many projects which had an irriversible impact on the planet's natural and human ecosystems. Such projects include a machine that paves roads wherever he goes, a missile satellite system capable of blowing up anything in his way, and building a mile-high statue of himself in the ocean. These projects destroyed most of the environment on Earth </div>
