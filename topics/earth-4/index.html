			<div class="topic-stories-collection" id="phillip-stories"></div> 		
		
			<div class="topic-info"><br>Earth 4 is a planet located on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth 3, as well as from Earth 5. It is an entirely desertous planet, having no oceans and being almost entirely devoid of rain, surface water, and non-human life. The planet has an increasing human population on average of 5 billion people, however this number fluctuates greatly from day to day. Despite the large population, there are no inhabited civilizations on Earth 4. There is only one address on Earth 4 which interglobal shipping standards currently recognizes, known as Phillip's House and is the permanent residence of Phillip Ball. The planet has no economy, infastructure, ecosystems, agriculture, transportation system, or formal governing body.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Called "Phillip's World" by some, this planet has been the residence of Phillip Ball since August 2021. Since that date, Phillip has acted as the de facto ruler over the planet, whose population has routinely followed his orders since Phillip's arrival.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Before this, Earth 4 was widely considered a prosperous and advanced planet, having the highest global GDP and exports of raw and processed resources. Earth 4 was also known for its technological and cultural exports which had a profound impact on all Earths. The planet was the first to establish contact with other Earths in 1939 when Earth 4 explorers translated to the cities of Earth 5. Since then, Earth 4 has been an important trade hub due to its position and superior interglobal-transportation technology and infastructure. In the transglobal economy, many considered the planet essential.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Upon Phillip's arrival and establishment of control, he undertook many projects which had an irriversible impact on the planet's natural and human ecosystems. Such projects include a machine that paves roads wherever he goes, a missile satellite system capable of blowing up anything in his way, and building a mile-high statue of himself on the ocean. These projects destroyed most of the environment on Earth and led to most established civilizations falling into ruin. Since 2022, Phillip has established his permanent residence in North America, where the vast majority of the Earth 4 population resides around in what is referred to as "the crowd".<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Earth 4 has been and continues to be the subject of a major humanitarian crisis. As there exists no means for Earth 4 citizens to grow food for themselves, the population has been fed solely by the efforts of charity organizations across the Earths. As a result, the agriculture industry remains severely strained and the situation on Earth 4 continues to draw resources away from other crises throughout the worlds. Change for Earth 4's circumstance in the near future is unlikely.<br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-subsection-title">HISTORY OF EARTH 4 BEFORE PHILLIP BALL</div>
			<div class="topic-info"><br>The overall history of Earth 4 is regarded by most historians to be the most prosperous and peaceful of any planet in the Earth system. There exist notable differences in the history of Earth 4 as compared to other Earths. For example, the crucades of the 11th to 13th centuries were a collaborative effort between Christians, Muslims, and Jews to build a new and prosperous kingdom in the Holy Land. Another example includes a much more peaceful joint exploration of the Americas by European and East Asian kingdoms, where efforts to prevent epidemics among Native Americans resulted in a boom of revolutionary medical research.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Among the most famous examples however is the unfolding of the "Space Race" between the Soviet Union and the Greater United States of America. Not only did this event occur 20 years earler, but it was a partnership between the two countries to further interglobal travel. The event started when scientists detected the presence of another Earthlike world on the opposite side of the Sun. The efforts culminated in the invention of the first Position Shifter which all future models would be based on. This device allowed the first explorers to translate to the western Eurasian Steppes of Earth 5 and make the first interglobal contact.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">From there, the nations of Earth 4 would become the leading forces of Interglobalization, acting as a trade hub between the Earths due to its advanced infastructure which could handle mass Position Shifting. They also establshed the Treaty of Earths, which proclaimed a ban on all interglobal war. The last planet to sign this treaty was Earth 7 in 1980, unifying much of Earth territory under this treaty.<sup style="font-size:70%"><span classs='footnote' id='ftna'onclick="FootNote('ftna','The only populated Earth to not join this treaty is Earth 1, of which less than half of its nations have individually signed the treaty.');">[a]</span></sup><br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Before 2021, Earth 4 was also known for its scholars and philosiphy on the topic of interglobalization and governance. Papers and documents published in the universities of Earth 4 shaped the way countries governed and communicated with each other throughout their existence, and are credited with helping to spread peace among the worlds. Within Earth 4, these Universities have long been connected with local state governments and their establishment, helping to cultivate communities built on communal trust and respect for others. The people of Earth 4 have long been described as friendly, community-oriented, and accepting of change and new ideas.<br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-subsection-title">PHILLIP BALL: FROM INFLUENCER TO WORLD LEADER</div>
			<div class="topic-info"><br>In April 2020, BCNN would begin their advertising campaign for Phillip Ball's book <em>University of Stone</em>. Phillip quickly became an international icon across Earth 1, and BCNN sought to expand his influence to other worlds. While governments on other Earths were fast to welcome Phillip, he was met with resistance when BCNN officials applied to screen Phillip Ball content on Earth 4 stations. BCNN had long had a negative relationship with Earth 4 governments. BCNN was not allowed a private media station on public networks until 2010, and even then had to have material approved by a global board.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">The Earth 4 Board of Public Media routinely rejected the broadcasting of Phillip Ball-related media until February of 2021. During this time, BCNN lodged an appeal stating that Phillip Ball and his beliefs were being unfairly discriminated against without public approval. Eventaully, this appeal was accepted by the board and Phillip Ball content was allowed to stream on any Earth 4 network.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">The public on Earth 4 soon became enthralled with Phillip, where he established himself as a household name. As 2021 continued and BCNN and Phillip Ball began to separate, Phillip's beliefs and statements became more and more aggressive and focused on violence. This caused Earth 4 to reinstate their ban on Phillip. Despite this, many residents continued to follow Phillip through underground and illegal networks. Officials attempetd to shut down criminal organizations that distributed Phillip content, however these groups multiplied quickly and gained widespread support as prosecution continued.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">In August 2021, after Phillip broke his contract with BCNN and was being actively pursued for prosecution, he declared his intention to move to Earth 4 where his followers were "most dedicated and loyal". Earth 4 quickly placed a travel ban on Phillip, and in response Phillip declared the governments of Earth 4 evil and in need of destruction. Chaos and anarchy quicly ensued on the planet as underground Phillip supporters took to the streets and revolted. Coups were started against nations across the planet and order quickly disbanded. Officials were faced with voicing total support for Phillip or being deposed.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">With the help of loyal supporters on Earth 1 and 4, Phillip safely translated to Earth 4 and assumed total control over the planet. Local governments still standing pledged loyalty to Phillip. Shortly after, he began his own advertising campain to help him complete his book.<br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-subsection-title">EARTH 4 UNDER PHILLIP'S REGIME</div>
			<div class="topic-info"><br>During Phillip's inaguration speech, he declared that is one and only promise to the public was to write his book <em>University of Stone</em>, and all his future decrees would be centered around this goal. From then on, the public served Phillip Ball with the intention of helping him achieve his goal.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Many of Phillip's decrees centered around travel, as Phillip claimed he gained inspiration through a change in scenery. Phillip preferred to drive, so he ordered the building of a machine that would pave roads anywhere he went. The machine had to be capable of paving up mountains and across the ocean. Phillip also often felt inconvenienced by natural and man-made structures that "got in the way", so he ordered for the building of a satellite system that could launch missiles and destroy anything that he felt got in the way. This system was used frequently and missiles had to be replenished often. Other inventions include a giant slingshot, x-ray goggles, and tunnels through the Earth itself.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">However, some days Phillip was not willing to travel, and he would order for natural and man-made sights to be built wherever he was. Such examples include building a full replica of New York City in Southeast Asia, creating a partial reconstruction of Mt Everest in Australia, and building the Pyramids of Giza at least 3 different times.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Finally, Phillip also deemed it necessary for his influence to be spread through lavish projects depicting himself. Anywhere Phillip went, he ordered paintings, sculptures, tapestries, films, and plays (just to name a few) depicting himself in herioic and extraordinary circumstances. In a well known instance, he ordered a mile tall statue of himself built within a month that would rest on a pedastal that rose from the middle of the Pacific ocean. Phillip also had 100 foot statues of himself buried deep underground wherever he went so his reputation on Earth 4 would live well after Phillip left Earth 4.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Phillip's demands and projects had an unprecedented effect on the planet in many aspects, which caused great devastation by February 2022. The resources needed for Phillip's operations were significant, and by February, all fossil fuels and nuclear energy sources on the planet had been spent, with other natural resources being greatly depleted. Through Phillip's unmitigated efforts, many greenhouse gasses and other hazardous chemicals were released into the atmosphere, and by March the average global temperature rose by 10 degrees Celsius.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Also to note is the population boom on Earth 4. Before Phillip's entrance, Earth 4 had a low population of about 2.32 billion people, maintained by a public effort to avoid overpopulation and conserve resources. But upon Phillip's arrival, many workers were needed for his projects and by 2022 the population had risen to over 4 billion. In an effort to feed this massive population increase, farmers resorted to unsustainable farming practices, which would quickly destroy most of the farmland and surrounding ecosystems on Earth 4 by mid-2022.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">The result of this was near total environmental destruction. Almost all forests across Earth 4 had been killed and only the most resistant plant and animal life were among those living beings that survived Phillip's activities. Nearly all ecosystems on Earth 4 had been destroyed, and Earth 4 was reduced to a desert world. Also to note is that all the oceans on the planet had also evaporated, however the cause of this is unknown, with some believing it to be the will of Phillip Sun.<br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-subsection-title">PHILLIP SETTLES; EARTH 4 IN THE MODERN DAY</div>
			<div class="topic-info"><br>Some time in early 2022, Phillip declared his permanent residence on Earth 4 as a house in the former US state of Ohio. He also declared he would not leave his house and the land it rested on until his book was finished. From then on, almost all of the 4-5 billion population would permanently reside around Phillip's house in grouping of people known as "the crowd".<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Since the permanent establishment of Phillip's House, the crowd has surrounded Phillip, with a radius spanning at least hundreds of miles at all times. Occasionally this crowd may partially disperse at the order of Phillip, such as when Phillip demanded more ink for his pen, which saw billions searching across the Earth to find ink for Phillip.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">To this day, Phillip continues work on his book with the crowd surrounding him. After Phillip's war on the environment, there exists no farmland or wildlife on the planet. The population on Earth 4 depends entirely on humanitarian efforts for food and other basic resources. There exists no system of communication on the planet, and all information is conveyed by word of mouth. The crowds often become dangerous and violent, especially during long periods of time without a public appearance by Phillip. Despite all of these factors, people arrive by the millions every day to serve Phillip. The current population of Earth 4 hovers at around 5 billion.<br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-subsection-title">THE IMPACT OF PHILLIP'S EARTH 4 ON THE WORLDS</div>
			<div class="topic-info"><br>Phillip's regime on Earth 4 has caused problems on an interglobal scale, arguably the most severe of which is the agricultural crisis from attempting to feed Earth 4. After agriculture began to collapse on Earth 4 and the population began to starve, humanitarian organizations across the Earths shifted their focus to providing food for the struggling population. However the scale of hunger on the planet was overwhelming, and charity groups struggled to find enough sources of food to meet the demand. This demand sparked numerous advances in the field of agriculture, however in the end resources had to be diverted from other areas in need to prevent total starvation on Phillip's world.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Another interglobal catastrophe caused by Earth 4 is population declines across the Earths. As stated earlier, millions travel to reside permanently on Earth 4 in an effort to serve Phillip. As Phillip's popularity is found across most Earths, the consequence of this is drops in population of tens of millions each month. This has resulted in labor shortages across all affected Earths, as well as a signfiicant flow of funds out of these planets. To combat this, many countries have placed their own travel bans on Earth 4, however this has mostly resulted in the flow of money to criminal enterprises that focus on transporting people to Earth 4.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">A notable exception of all these catastrophes is Earth 3. The planet is entirely populated by being known as Phillips and pseudophils, who all share a common ancestry with the Earth 3 counterpart of Earth 1's Phillip Ball. Despite this, the Earth 3 population has been entirely immune from the Phillip craze that has swept the worlds. Also to note is that the Earth 3 population has remained historically unsympathetic towards non-Phillips, and engages with them only for the sake of international trade.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">As a result, humanitarian organizations based in Earth 3 have not diverted any resources towards the crisis on Earth 4, and the Phillip population remains well-fed. Also as there are no Phillip Ball fans on Earth 3, there have been no population drops caused by the Phillip migration to serve Phillip Ball.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">However despite this indifference, Earth 3 has come to capitalize on the situation and its impact on the other Earths. Farmers on Earth 3 have ramped up production in order to sell crops to humanitarian organizations at an increased price, and other organizations on the planet have benefitted similarly due to other related shortages. As a result, Earth 3 remains the largest supplier of food, medical resources, and other equipment for the population of Earth 4.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">While the situation has greatly benefitted Earth 3 financially, public opinion of Phillip Ball on Earth 3 has grown from indifferent to hostile over the past couple of years, and there is discussion among Earth 3 residents of cutting off food supply to Earth 4 entirely. The public opinion is that Phillip Ball is to blame for the crisis on Earth 4, and by the effort of these humanitarian organizations, Earth 3 is serving to enable Phillip. This shift in public opinion is shown by the further increasing of food prices coming from Earth 3 and a bill on the ground floor that would place a cap on how much food can be sold for the sake of feeding Earth 4. These decisions have caused panic across the world governments, and leave many worried about the future of Earth 4's population.<br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-subsection-title">CONCLUSION: THE FATE OF EARTH 4</div>
			<div class="topic-info"><br>Earth 4 is a planet once considered the most prosperous among all planets. In the modern day, it is known as the home of Phillip ball and his followers, who famously obey his every command. While Earth 4's future may be uncertain, it is much less doubted that Phillip will remain an influential figure on the interglobal scale for years to come.</div>
