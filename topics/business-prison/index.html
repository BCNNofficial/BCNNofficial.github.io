			<div class="topic-story-section"><strong><em>CHECK OUT STORIES RELATED TO BUSINESS PRISON</em></strong><br></div>
			<div class="topic-stories-collection" id="phillip-stories"></div> 		
		
			<div class="topic-info"><br>Business Prison is a penitentiary designed for those who conduct business. It exists in a plane of reality outside of the known universe. The structure of Business Prison resembles a modern office building, and contains spaces such as conference rooms, private offices, bathrooms, and break rooms. The majority of business prison consists of areas made up of office cubicles and computer desks where business can be conducted. All prisoners are given materials necessary for conducting business, such as cell phones, writing utensils, passwords for business accounts, and any required accommodations.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">Each business prisoner is assigned duties as part of their internment, which can be found by logging in to a computer and viewing required tasks. Prisoners do not have mandated hours and are free to take breaks when necessary. Sleep is not necessary in Business Prison. If someone performs their required duties well enough, they may be eligible for promotion, and can receive benefits such as personal offices and access to manager bathrooms. All prisoners are provided with up-to-date business information necessary to their employment. There also exists a large variety of corporate activities and other special events open to all prisoners.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">It is not entirely clear what causes someone to be sent to Business Prison. It is generally agreed that people who are sent to business prison have committed some act widely seen as unacceptable in the business world. Often someone is only sent to Business Prison when their crime is publicly exposed, however this is not always the case. A prisoner's time of incarceration is infinite, however there exist methods to escaping Business Prison. Even when provided with a means of escape, many choose to remain imprisoned. The administration of Business Prison is entirely unknown.<br><br><br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-subsection-title">HISTORY OF BUSINESS PRISON</div>
            <div class="topic-info"><br>Ancient documents have suggested that Business Prison has exised as long as humans have been conducting business. Since its discovery, humans have had the ability to communicate with those on Earths. The oldest document we have originating from Business Prison comes from an Ancient Mesopotamian merchant who had a stone tablet sent to his family, detailing an "a chasm of rooms without end, lit by torches and having documents of trade on every surface."<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">Analyzing Business Prison documents over the course of history revealed that the design and structure of its facilities have changed over time to meet the most modern standards of business. It is believed that this change is subtle, as while documents from prisoners rarely refer to any change in their scenery, personal testimonies from different time periods describe distinctly different scenes. It also appears that there have existed different sections of Business Prison with different design, representing the large variety of cultures across the Earths.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">While the structure and technology of business prison change ove time to meet modern standards, the core aspects of Business Prison have remained unchanged. People in Business Prison do not age and are incapable of sleep. Business prison has always allowed 30-60 minute breaks for lunch and 10-15 minute breaks throughout the work-period.<br><br><br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-subsection-title">BUSINESS PRISON IN THE MODERN DAY</div>
            <div class="topic-info"><br>The Business Prison website describes their space in the following terms: "<em>Business Prison has a modern look which sports a minimalist yet innovative design choice. Our areas contain conference rooms fitted with modern telecommunications technology which helps our teams succeed, comfortable office spaces with ergonomic support built in, kitchen/pantry rooms fully-stocked with healthy materials that keep our workers rejuvinated, bathrooms, and breakout areas that inspire creativity within our team. We also have professional lounging areas perfect for networking opportunities."</em><br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info"><em>"All of our office spaces are fitted with the high-end technology our team wants and the comfort that keeps them ready to succeed. Our technology is equipped with top-of-the-line software that empowers our workers in their fields and has the perfect platforms to jumpstart networking opportunities. Our design helps to inspire our workers on a daily basis. Our spaces are also fitted with the latest internet technology that allow our team to connect with others on the Web."</em><br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info"><em>"Business Prison has a variety of programs and workshops that empower our workers and help them to move forward with their careers. We host a large variety of conferences that help to build confidence, communication, flexibility, integrity, ambition, motivation, and responsibility. We also hold regular trainings that promote an environment of respect for all coworkers. Our conferences are designed to be engaging and innovative, inspiring our workers to achieve and succeed in the workplace."</em><br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">The purpose of Business Prison and its activities within the business world are unclear. It is also unclear who the administrators of Business Prison and what their associations are. Our investiagetive reporters outside of and within<sup style="font-size:70%"><span classs='footnote' id='ftna'onclick="FootNote('ftna','No reporters are assigned to Business Prison reporting unless they volunteer for the position or are recruited from the Business Prison population.');">[a]</span></sup> Business Prison are unable to conclude on such information. They also do not have details about this information available on their website.<br><br><br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-subsection-title">LIFE OF BUSINESS PRISONERS</div>
            <div class="topic-info"><br>There exist several different ranks of prisoners that come with different levels of privileges. Every prisoner enters at the lowest rank upon their arrival at Business Prison, but can be promoted through completing assigned tasks to a desired level. A promotion begins when a prisoner receives an email from a Business Prison administrator, stating that they are being considered for a new position and that they will be provided with more information. At this state, a prisoner may be assigned new tasks as part of their promotion process. It must be noted that promotions are competitive and that as many as 50 prisoners can be considered for a single promotion. As a prisoner is promoted, they receive more benefits but also receive additional duties that often get more vague in description as one progresses. It is unclear if there exists a highest rank in Business prison, or if a prisoner can be promoted to an administrator status.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">Before discussing ranks, it is important to note the difficulty of obtaining information about these positions. As one gains moer promotions, they become less willing to share information with our reporters. This is out of fear that potential administrators will reprimand their disclosing of Business Prison information, or that this information will be used against them by other prisoners seeking the same promotion.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">At the lowest rank, a prisoner's duties mostly consist of basic tasks, which include receiving data, entering data into spreadsheets, interpreting data, creating pie charts and bar graphs out of data, making slideshows about the data, writing reports about data, reading reports about data, copying data, and sending data. Occasionally, a prisoner may have to take calls and answer emails about the data they've received. Rarely, a prisoner may be required to print out infomation about the data and deliver it to another prisoner in person. This can often become a daunting task, given not only the vast size of Business prison (estimated to be over 86 million square miles), but also the challenge of finding a working printer that one can connect to and that isn't out of ink.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">Apart from duties, prisoners of this rank are scheduled for a 30-60 minute lunch break every 4 hours. Given that there exists no natural cycles in Business Prison such as the rising or setting of a sun, time is ofte given in terms of how long someone has before their break. Between prisoners of this rank, one's time spent in Business Prison is often measured in terms of lunch breaks taken. Each prisoner is allowed to take their break in the nearest break room, which contains various food items as well as a meal in a fridge with their name on it. Prisoner can also take 10-15 minute breaks when necessary. There also exist vending machines throughout Business Prison intended for prisoners, which can be accessed with employee ID cards. There also exist various administrator-organized activities available to all prisoners, which will be discussed later.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">At the next highest rank, a prisoner gains their first supervisory duties. These duties often involve assigning duties to lower-rank prisoners as dictated by administrators, as well as reviewing the work of other prisones. These duties include checking spreasheets of data for discrepancies, reviewing slideshows of data, reviewing and compiling reports on data, creating reports about two different sets of data, finding data, and sending multiple sources of data. These positions also require prisoners to deliver information, but these tasks can be delegated (though prisoners may avoid this if they wish to "show initiative"). This information is true for all higher ranks. Prisoners of this rank have the same break related benefits.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">For the third rank, prisoners begin to receive new benefits. These benefits include access to "manager bathrooms" which some claim are of a higher quality than the common prisoner bathrooms. These prisoners also gain access to conference rooms and have the ability to organize conferences. As part of this new ability, these prisoners gain duties related to planning and executing conferences as assigned by administrators. These conferences relate to the receiving of new data and new policies regarding data. In addition to this, these prisoners are considered responsible for making calls and sending emails in order to obtain new collections of data and inquire about new data sources. These prisoners are no longer assigned breaks and are accepted to take breaks when they feel is necessary. Some prisoners refuse to take breaks once achieving this position.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">The highest known ranks are often grouped together, as they all have similar duties which relate to the assigning of prisoners to certain areas. At these levels, prisoners are designated as "executives" over specific areas, having their own private offices within their zones. Within these areas, executives must maintain a required range of prisoners, and must transfer or ask for transfers to stay within these areas. They are also required to be the final sources of approval for reports on data before they are sent to corporate. It is also rumored that prisoners in these positions regularly communicate with administrators, but executive prisoners generally don't approve of communication with other prisoners, so this remains to be proven. If an executive is unable to perform to a specific standard, they are at risk of being demoted to a lower position.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">All prisoners are at risk of being removed from Business Prison. The reasons can range from a "lack of initiative" to "unbusinesslike conduct", "unprofessional behavior", or even a simple oversupply of prisoners. A prisoner's removal from Business Prison may be immediate or scheduled for several days in the future. It is often agreed that any prisoner is at risk of being removed from Business Prison for any reason. Those who are removed are sometimes seen again in the world outside of Business Prison.<br><br><br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-subsection-title">ACTIVITIES IN BUSINESS PRISON</div>
            <div class="topic-image-and-caption"><img class="topic-image" src="business prison info kiosk.jpeg" alt="informational kiosk surrounded by office desks in business prison"><div class="topic-image-caption">Photo of Business Informational Kiosk 5121x-1883, which displays the latest business. Prisoners can be seen in the background conducting business.</div></div>
            <div class="topic-info"><br>There exist a large variety of required and optional activities for prisoners outside of their assigned tasks. A key part of these activities involves the Business Informational Kiosks, which are found every half mile in a grid-like fashion. These interactive kiosks will display information on all events happening within the area. In addition, these kiosks display the most recent business, including news about business in the outside world and data every prisoner is expected to have access to.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info"><br>The most common type of activites are referred to as "conferences" and/or "workshops". These are events organized by administrators designed to "<em>Enhance the soft and hark skills of our workers and increase their quality of life and ability to succeed in the workplace</em>" as specified in memos regarding conferences. These activities can focus on personal skills, teamwork, communication, or other skills considerable by Business Prison administrators. They can also involve appropriate workplace behavior and tolerance training, as well as reviewing company policies. These conferences are accompanied by donuts, and are the only source of donuts in the entirely of Busniess Prison. As a result, prisoners will often collect donuts from trainings and compare with others. It must also be noted that these trainings also include images and video clips involving people from Busniess Prison administration. BCNN investigations have confirmed that the people who appear in these trainings are confirmed to not exist.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">Another common activity is "gatherings", which may or may not include feasts. These gatherings are seen as locations to "network" among the prisoners. In the Business Prison community, networking is seen as the most important activity one can engage in. It is the practice of forming a network, which involves establishing and maintaining contact with other prisoners. The more connections one can establish and maintain, the greater the network and the higher the worth of that prisoner is. Gathering are seen as important networking locations as prisoners of all ranks are encouraged to attend. BCNN investigations have not confirmed a link between networks and one's chances of promotion, demotion, or removal from Business Prison.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">A final common activity are "team-building exercises". These serve the core purpose of building an atmosphere of teamwork and cooperation between prisoners. Examples include "trust fall exercises", "collaborative painting", "appreciation circles", "collaborative timepiece making", "sack races", "collaborative surgery", "power circles", "collaborative torsion pyramid construction", and "special circles". These activities are often a source of items and materials found nowhere else in Business Prison, however removing items from any activity is prohibited by administration. It is not known what the consequences are for violating this rule.<br><br><br><Br></div>
            <div class="topic-subsection-title">STRUCTURE OF BUSINESS PRISON</div>
            <div class="topic-image-and-caption"><img class="topic-image" src="business prison outer areas.jpeg" alt="highly distorted office cube"><div class="topic-image-caption">A structure found in the "Outer Zone" of Business Prison.</div></div>
            <div class="topic-info"><br>Among prisoners, the layout of Business Prison is often divided into two division: the Inner Zone and the Outer Zone. The Inner Zone refers to the area where working prisoners are regularly found, and where anomolies in the Business Prison structure are rare. The Outer Zone instead refers to an area past the Inner Zone where working prisoners refrain from going and where the design of Business Prison becomes unpredictable.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">The Inner Zone area is generally designated as all area within 5,000 miles of the proposed "center" of Business Prison. Within this area, Business Prison exists essentially as a massive building, ranging in 20-50 stories depending on one's position in the Inner Zone, with stairs and elevators taking people between the floors. Most of the space within these buildings exist as either vast spaces filled with computer desks and offices, or desnsely packed layers of office cubicles. It is these locations at which the lowest ranks of prisoners complete their duties. Scattered throughout these spaces can be found private offices, bathrooms, break rooms, conference rooms, and other specific areas. Most activties are held in English, the language most text in written in, however this can vary depending on the language demographics of an area.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">The building of Business Prison cannot be left. There exist no doors or openable windows that lead out of Business Prison<sup style="font-size:70%"><span classs='footnote' id='ftnc'onclick="FootNote('ftnc','This excludes exits that lead out of Business Prison, discussed in the Leaving Business Prison section.');">[c]</span></sup>, and any windows there might be are reistant to all available methods of breaking them. Reports claim that there exist only empty voids above and below Business Prison.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">Closer to the center, spaces within Business Prison are small and have little variation. However as one moves farther from the center, hallways and rooms have more variation, either becoming more spacious or more cramped. The popuation density of Business Prison also decreases as one moves farther from the center. When prisoners enter Business Prison, they are likely to appear near the center, but have the possibility to appear anywhere within the structure. Despite population differences, BCNN investigations suggest that the frequency of activities is constant everywhere in Business Prison, and these activies are held in all areas regardless of the number of people present. Informational kiosks are also still found every 1/2 mile everywhere in Business Prison. This information is true even for the Outer Zone.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">Once a prisoner moves past 5,000 miles from the center<sup style="font-size:70%"><span classs='footnote' id='ftnb'onclick="FootNote('ftnb','As the Inner and Outer Zones are not designations recognized by Business Prison administrators, there exist no markings between the zones. However one can record distance from the center using their phone if set up correctly.');">[b]</span></sup>, they are considered to be in the Outer Zone. As mentioned, spaces in Business Prison become more varied as one moves farther from the Center. However the Outer Zone marks the area where these variations become impractical. Spaces can become impossibly large, with rooms being hundreds or even thousands of stories tall. Spcaes can also become too cramped for workers to enter, and may fold in on themselves. Rooms appear in strange orientations and can appear inside of themselves. Floors, ceilings and walls become slanted, jagged, have holes or be altogether absent farther out.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">All aspects of Business Prison become more unpredictable in the Outer Zone. As one moves farther deep into this zone, they can expect to find unusual items in pantries and break rooms, such as unbaked dough, raw meat, vitamins and medicines, or even non-edible items like jars of sawdust, acids, nails, and unidentified materials. Hosted activities also become more nonsensical as one moves farther out, with activity names like "glue eating covenant", "aerosols experiments", "mashed chair activity", and even unintelligible names like "sers heHS hr" or "aaأسبوع最新的ss.q". Administrators hosting these events act in seemingly unpredictable ways.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">BCNN's Safety Ranking of II applies only to the Inner Zone, and one can expect the level of danger to increase as they move farther from the center.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">It is unknown if there is an end to the Outer Zone, or to Business Prison as a whole. It is also unclear if there are other being that exist in Business Prison other than humanlike beings from the Earths. There have been reports of non-human beings in the far depths of the Outer Zone, however these reports remain unconfirmed.<br><br><br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-subsection-title">LEAVING BUSINESS PRISON</div>
            <div class="topic-info"><br>There exists no reliable way of escaping Business Prison, but escape is possible and opportunities to escape are often provided to prisoners. Among the most common ways to escape is through being "removed" by administration. Contrary to common consensus among Prisoners, one's chance of being removed does not increase by neglecting duties, disobeying company policies, harassing or attacking other prisoners, not attending activities, or going against expectations in any way. Reasons are given for removal, but these reasons generally don't reflect the actions of the prisoner.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">A common false myth among prisoners is that a person will be removed if they attack an administrator during an activity. Though removal is a possibility, it is among the least common. The most likely outcome of assaulting an administrator is a transferral. Usually, the prisoner is transferred to another location within the Inner Zone, however some prisoners have been sent to the Outer Zone. Other outcomes of an assault include a "suspension", where prisoners will dissapear for days, weeks, months, or even years at a time, a demotion, a removal of privileges for a period of time, and execution.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">Another myth is that the chance of removal is more common in the Outer Zone. Though not unproven by BCNN investigations, this myth remains to be proven definitively. It is known that throughout all of Business Prison, "exits" can be found (such as doors, windows, hatches, or holes) that appear to lead out of the Business Prison building. These doors commonly act as portals to other sections of Business Prison, but they may also transport a person to a realm of existence outside of Business Prison. The myth is that these exits become more common in the Outer Zone of Business Prison, or that an exit my be "forced upon" a peson in the Outer Zone.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">A final myth states that if someone reaches a high enough rank, they are allowed to leave Business Prison to any location they desire. Though no evidence exists for this claim, it has not been unproven due to the high secrecy of people who reach executive ranks. Often, the exact ranks of these individuals is unknown, and they are raraly seen outside of their private offices.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">The fate of a prisoner who is removed is unpredictable. Occasionally these people are seen again, but it is estimated that under half of those who are removed return to one the the Earths, and even less return to their Earth of origin. Even more troubling is that less than a quarter return to their original time. The period between appearing and disappearing can range from a couple hours to years and potentially centuries. There have been occasional reports of someone from a different century being removed from Business Prison and appearing in our modern day, and some prisoners claim they are sent from the future. Though evidence exists for these claims, they remain difficult to prove due to a lack of evidence of when exactly prisoners leave Business Prison, however it's generally agreed that prisoners are often sent some period of time into the future at the least.<br><br><br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-subsection-title">CONCLUSION: THE BUSINESS OF BUSINESS PRISON</div>
            <div class="topic-info"><br>Business Prison is a massive complex that exists in a realm outside of the one we are familiar with. It houses prisoners that are commonly regarded as having committed some "business crime", and these prisoners have been sentenced to Business Prison since the dawn of business. Nothing is known about its purpose and its administration. It is likely that Business Prison will continue to function for the forseeable future.<br><br></div>
