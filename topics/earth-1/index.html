			<div class="topic-info"><br>Earth-1 is a planet located on the opposite side of the former Earth-2. The planet has an average global GDP, population, and overall standard of living. It is the only planet aside from Earth-8 that is not opposite of 2 Earths, and is the only Earth opposite from no planet after Earth-2's destruction. There have been no near or total destruction of civilization events on Earth-1. The history of Earth-1 has been neither especially violent or peaceful.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">Earth-1 has been relatively isolated from the global scene. The existence of other Earths was not known until 1971 during the Apollo missions of the US government of Earth-1. Due to the threat of Agarthan entities on <a href='https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/earth-3/'>Earth-3</a> and the Centuries War on Earth-2, interglobal trade was slow to migrate to Earth-1 since it first began on 1939. Even when contact was established, governments preferred to isolate themselves from these other Earth governments. After catastrophic events occurred on Earth-2, -3, and -4, Earth-1 continued to become more and more removed from the global scene. Today, few Earth-1 companies conduct business outside of their home planet.<br><br><br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-subsection-title">HISTORY OF EARTH-1</div>
            <div class="topic-info"><br>Human history and progress on the planet has been mostly unimpeded. The Agartha-1 under the surface was especially docile and remained undiscovered until investigation by government powers during the global Second World War of 1939-1945. Lunar threats have also been widlely nonexistent in Earth-1's history. Energetic sciences such as sacred geometry and torsion fields were also widely unknown until around this time period. Even in the modern day, these technologies are widely unimplemented in modern life. Interestingly, use of energetic sciences appeared to be somewhat common during early human history, but was phased out with the further development of civilization.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">As a result of the lack of threats against humanity as a whole, the technological advances of Earth-1 are generally regarded as lesser compared to other Earths, as most human threats that would have spurred progress were other humans. The lack of interaction with Moon-1 and Agartha-1 also kept humanity from exposure to these other fields. Earth-1 technology was more advance in specific fields, but these advancement are generally agreed to have not served the Earth-1 governments well on the global stage. For example, rocket technology was especially advance, which led the government of this planet to explore space using rocket technology. This form of space travel is wildly inefficient compared to methods of other Earths such as Position or Phase Shifters.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">The discovery of energetic technologies, considered important today in the interglobal environment, was likely more common in early history as mentioned, but since then these discoveries have been made and lost throughout Earth-1 history with the rise and fall of civilizations. It is hypothesized that these discoveries were repeatedly lost because they could not be easily implemented on a mass scale, and their use was not necessary to the survival of humans. <br><bR>However during the 1940s and 1950s, global conflicts spurred massive technological developmens and led governments to spend money on many fields of research previously shunned. Often this resulted in embezzlement or other forms of fraud, but it led to some research into energetic science. However by the time of interglobal contact, this technology was still far behind that of other Earths. The public also was (and still remains) skeptical of research on these topics. These technologies were also investigated by individuals and corporations, such as Theodosius Bustian, the founder of BCNN.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">It was also during this period that humans of Earth-1 began their exploration into Agartha-1. Progress remained slow due to the inability of these humans to combat Agarthan entities without energetic technology. Progress on exploring Moon-1 was also nonexistant due to the use of rocket technology for reaching celestial objects.<br><bR><br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-subsection-title">INTERGLOBAL CONTACT WITH EARTH-1</div>
            <div class="topic-info"><br>From the 50s to the 70s of Earth-1 history, space exploration was fueled by a conflict known as the Space Race, which was a competition between the planet's superpowers, the United Stated and the USSR, to develop the most advance space-travelling technology.<Br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">It is not clear when the scientific community proposed the existence of a planet opposite of the Sun from their Earth. Some have guessed that early photographs from orbits around other non-Earth planets caught glimpses of Earth-2, or that energetic technology was implemented into telescopes and other tracking technologies to suggest Earth-2's presence. In any case, its existence was confirmed and shared with the public in 1969. After a flight that placed men on Moon-1 in their Apollo program, the US announced Earth-2's discovery and an expansion of their Apollo program to send huamns to this other planet.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">After several orbits around Earth-2 that went unnoticed, which revealed the shocking discovery that this planet was geographically identical to their Earth, the US government launched the flight known as Apollo 14. It included the same astronauts that first stepped on Moon-1, who were Neil Armstrong, Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin, and Michael Collins. The flight successfully landed in the Pacific Ocean of Earth-2, just off the coast from the Second American Coalition Government.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">Unknown to Earth-1 officials, Earth-2 had been embrioled in a global war for 211 years as of Apollo 14's landing. The SACG military quickly apprehended the vessle and arrested the astronauts, believing them to be enemy spies. SACG officials refused to believe the astronauts and the existence of Earth-1 at first, however after the technology on-board the Earth-1 vessel could not be explained, experiments were conducted by the SACG and allies that confirmed the existence of this final Earth.<sup style="font-size:70%"><span classs='footnote' id='ftna'onclick="FootNote('ftna','Earth-1 remains the last Earth to be discovered still in orbit around the Sun.');">[a]</span></sup><br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">In 1974, SACG made contact with the United States of Earth-1. The two nations attempted to form an alliance, however after the US refused to trade resources for the return of the Apollo 14 astronauts, contact was cut off. It wasn't until <a href='https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/earth-4/'>Earth-4</a> ambassadors reached the Final Earth in 1977 was interglobal communication restored. Through negotiations, the Apollo 14 prisoners were eventually returned to Earth-1 in 1986.<br><br><br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-subsection-title">SLOW INTRO OF EARTH-1 TO THE GLOBAL SCENE</div>
            <div class="topic-info"><br>Some suspect that before the Earth-4 ambassadors reached Earth-1, other governments of the planet attempted to establish contact with Earth-2 by sending their own astronauts, however if this is true, then evidence of the flights never survived. Even when Earth-4 ambassadors reached planet at the USSR tundras, world governments remained skeptical and did not trust the Earth-4 officials.<br><bR></div>
            <div class="topic-info">Slowly, position shifting technology was distributed to the governments of Earth-1 and the first interglobal shipping port was established outside of Bejing in 1982. Trade connections began to form with Earth-1 industries, including  weapons and raw resource transportation with Earth-2 and <a href='https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/earth-3/'>-3</a> governments engaged in war.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">Interglobal interactions outside of trade remained nonexistent on Earth-1. The overall science and technology scene was uninteresting to the governments of other worlds, and Earth-1 governments remained distrustful due to the initial events on Earth-2. The countries of Earth-1 also refused to unanimously sign an interglobal peace treaty that forbade conflict with nations on other planets.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">It should be noted that, as is the situation today, many are either distrustful of non-Earth-1 states or do not believe in their existence. After the disaster of Apollo 14, most were against further interplanetary exploration. Further engagements with other Earths were often not made public, and facilities that had interglobal contact like shipping ports were built away from public view. Due to this lack of transparency, it is why many news organizations do not report on interglobal matters, and why BCNN's mission to inform the public is so important, due to our superior interglobal presence and investigation and our desire to serve the public.<br><br><br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-subsection-title">EARTH-1 ISOLATED FROM INTERGLOBAL POLITICS; EXPANDING INFLUENCE</div>
            <div class="topic-info"><br>A significant event that detached Earth-1 from the global scene was the destruction of Earth-2 in 1996. Due to illegal research into orgone energy, the South State of Europe created an entity now known today as the Major Phillip Ball. It was a sphere of pure orgone energy that continued to grow in size, consuming the enrgy of surrounding matter. Despite efforts from across the Earths, the growth of the Major Phillip Ball could not be stopped and it consumed all of Earth-2, officially destroying the planet on 2 December 1996.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">Many Earth-1 nations gained much of their revenue from Earth-2 trade, so the planet's collapse was a severe shock to the economy. Though the economy recovered, it led many international powers to distrust the interglobal economic scene, and the Earth-1 market became highly isolated.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">Another factor of isolation was immigration policies on Earth-1. Before Earth-2's destruction, all governments on Earth-1 with international shipping ports placed strict bans on immigration. With the slow collapse of Earth-2, a refugee crisis emerged, which placed great strain on all other Earths. Despite requests from other Earth governments, Earth-1 forces only strengthened their immigration bans, which damaged relations and resulted in the cutting of many diplomatic missions and trade deals.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">Trade and diplomatic talk picked back up in the late 2000s, however relations again became damaged after events on <a href='https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/earth-3/'>Earth-3</a>. On the third planet, a war between humans and Agarthan entities was worsening, and many human governments were buckling under the pressure. Throughout the situation, Earth-1 refused to donate resources to Earth-3 or assist in the migrant crisis. Earth-3's situation came to an end on 22 July 2013 when a catastrophic event killed all life on the planet, which was later repopulated by the beings known as Phillips. Any companies or governments that traded with Earth-3 suffered economic shock, and again a period of isolation began. Again some organizations began to trade and interact on the interglobal scene, but after <a href='https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/phillip-ball/'>Phillip Ball</a> led the population of <a href='https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/earth-4/'>Earth-4</a> to ruin, investors again pulled back.<br><br></div>
            <div class="topic-info">But while Earth-1 governments and corporations have had little impact on other Earths, the cultural impact the final earth has had on the Earths system is profound. Aside from the popularity of Earth-1 media on other Earths, as well as BCNN and its worlds-class reporting, the most profound cultural icon that has its origin on Earth-1 is <a href='https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/phillip-ball/'>Phillip Ball</a>. Phillip Ball originally parterned with BCNN, who managed the writer's advertising campaign and helped him achieve international popularity across the planet. This campaign expanded to other planets, and soon Phillip became a household name on almost all populated Earths.<br><bR></div>
            <Div class="topic-info">Eventually, Phillip Ball parted ways with BCNN and began his own efforts on Earth-4 during 2021. By 2022, Phillip established interglobal control, destroyed all existing governments, and turned the planet into a wasteland. Today, Phillip writes his book in his permanent residence while billions surround him daily. Many millions migrate to Earth-4, and this emigration crisis, as well as starvation across the planet, has caused major issues for all other Earths. Despite this, Phillip Ball remains popular with most on other worlds.<br><br><br><br></Div> 
            <div class="topic-subsection-title">CONCLUSION: EARTH-1 IN THE MODERN DAY</div>
            <div class="topic-info"><br>Today, Earth-1 remains removed from the interglobal scene. Conflicts on the planet remain almost entirely concerned, and the only impact the Earth has is indirect through its cultural exports. This is unlikely to change in the future.<br><br></div>
