			<div class="topic-info"><br>Earth-3 is a planet located on the opposite side of the Sun from <a href="https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/earth-4/">Earth-4</a> and from the former Earth-2. It is a planet entirely inhabited by humanlike beings called Phillips and pseudophils, who all share their ancestry with the former Earth-3 human Phillip Sun. All non-Phillip intelligent lifeforms<sup style="font-size:70%"><span classs='footnote' id='ftna'onclick="FootNote('ftn1','Phillip lifeforms are defined as those descending from Phillip Sun. Therefore, despite physical similarities, Phillip Ball is not considered a Phillip lifeform and is barred from entering Earth-3.');">[a]</span></sup> are banned from entering the planet, where violators are faced with capital punishment. In the modern day, Earth-3 is widely considered the most prosperous place to live and has the highest standards of living for those who are considered Phillips. Although, political instability has been increasing due to ill treatment of pseudophils on the planet.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Prior to 22 July 2013, Earth-3 much mose closely resembled other Earths in the system, having an entirely human population with similar political makeup. However even then, Earth-3 was seen as distinct from other Earths due to high levels of unpredictability. The Agartha-3 at the center of the planet was seen as the most dangerous among all the Earths, and threats would frequently emerge to the surface and cause havoc. Sicne the establishment of the BCNN Safety Scale Ranking in 1973, Earth-3 had hovered between IV (unsafe) and V (mildly dangerous) for all human residents.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">In the years before 22 July 2013, the appearance of otherworldly threats rose dramatically, and the societies of Earth-3 were plunged into instability. This culminated in the 22 of July, where a catastrophic event occured that killed almost all humans on the planet. The exact events of the Catastrophe are unknown as it was highly spontaneous, but it resulted in one human (widely considered to be the Earth-3 counterpart of <a href='https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/phillip-ball/'>Phillip Ball</a>) being imbued with extreme power and inhabiting the sun, creating the being known as Phillip Sun. Using these newfound powers, Phillip Sun repopulated Earth-3 with unique being that would come to be known as Phillips and pseudophils, who would build their own civilizations and found a new society of Phillips.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">There exist two classes of Phils on Earth-3: Phillips and pseudophils. While Phillips enjoy some of the highest living standards in the world, pseudophils are considered an oppressed group of people and have limited rights compared to Phillips. This oppression is exhibited many ways, from pseudophils often having factory, construction, or other unsafe forms of employments, to inhibitive laws that prevent pseudophils from conducting business, being without debt, and enjoying themselves.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">In the current day, Earth-3 has the highest global GDP and the most renound universities, as well as some of the most famous financial and technological centers. The most recent advances in technology, science, and other fields are often found on Earth-3, thanks to the efforts of pioneering figures like Phillip Inventor, Phillip Economist, Phillip Structural Engineer, and Phillip Discoverer to name a few.<br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-subsection-title">EARTH-3: BEFORE THE CATASTROPHE</div>
			<div class="topic-info"><br>Earth-3 has a long history of unearthly threats that has plagued humankind on the planet, which scholars have long believed are due to abnormalities in Earth-3 core, Agartha-3. Though all Earths have a hollow world with beings not found on the surface, and though what is found at the core is different from Earth to Earth, the physical and energetic power of Agartha-3 entities was unusually strong, and these entities were unusually violent and pervasive on Earth-3's surface.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">A consequence of this is that conflict between humans was historically rare on Earth-3. Survival on ancient Earth-3 was extremely difficult, so civilizations on Earth-3 required high degrees of cooperation and teamwork to last. War between groups of people was seen as a last resort when compromise couldn't be reached, and almost always ended in the destruction of all groups involved.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">As societies on Earth-3 developed and started to become interconnected, they developed better ways of combatting Agarthan entities. Important to note is that while all Agarthan entities tend to have high energetic power compared to surface entities, this energetic strength for Agartha-3 entities was uncharacteristically high. As a result, people of the planet developed advance technology in fields such as torsion fields and sacred geometry to defend themselves. Societies on Earth-3 were also historically controlling and millitaristic. Common among all civilizations on the Earth is a strong focus on self defense and combat, as well as an understanding of energetic forces.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">As society further developed, it became easier to manage these entities. By the early 1900s, life on Earth-3 began to resemble life on other planets and history began to move into an era of peace. This development was furthered when <a href='https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/earth-4/'>Earth-4</a> explorers made conatct with the governments of Earth-3. Officials of Earth-4 were impressed by their torsion and geometric technology, and traded their own developments with the states and kingdoms of Earth-3. This boom in new technology better equipped militaries against the Agarthan entities and resulted in another drop in Agarthan-related fatalities.<br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-subsection-title">THE WAR INTO AGARTHA-3</div>
			<div class="topic-info"><br>In the 1970s, as a result of this new era of peace, public opinion shifted towards a desire to further secure their peace by invading Agartha-3. Several governments began campaigns that sent troops into the Hollow Earth with the intention of destroying all Agarthan lifeforms and their civilizations.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Reactions to these new initiatives were mixed. The war on Agartha-3 had been the cause of many human deaths, which many argued were "pointless" when peace had existed for decades at this point. There also began a movement in the late 80s to stop the war and protect the lives of Agarthan entities, which followers claimed were "just as valuable as human lives". The movement posited that an effort was never made on either side to understand the other, and that world governments had surpressed findings that these beings were just as intelligent as humans. This movement was criminalized by all Earth-3 governments and was heavily persecuted.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">The war into Agartha had seen success throughout the rest of the 20th century, with forces establishing permanent bases in the Hollow Earth. However starting in the 2000s, these advances stalled as forces reported a new influx of stronger entities. Forcese continues to become more and more overwhelming and by 2008, all Hollow Earth bases had to be abandoned. Despite this, military forces contined to prevent Agarthan entities from reaching the surface.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">However in 2010, there was a sudden spike in the strength and number of Agarthan entities, and breaches onto the Earth-3 surface were reported across the planet. The causes for this are unknown, however most scholars at least partially link this event to cults originating from pro-Agarthan movements of the 80s and 90s. After heavy persecution, members of these movements took to forming paramilitary groups underground with the goal of overthrowing current Earth-3 governments. Though reports of this are unconfirmed, it is also believed that members of these groups established contact with the Agarthan entities, and they shared technology. This hypothesis is a popular explanation for how Agartha-3 groups could suddently break past human forces.<br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-subsection-title">THE CATASTROPHE</div>
			<div class="topic-info"><br>In the three years to follow, there was widespread governmental collapse as Hollow Earth entities and pro-Agarthan forces invaded, and Earth-3 became embroiled in war. In the Earth-3 kingdoms that stood, martial law was declared and forces became dictatorial over their population. Though these governments received interglobal support from most Earths, Agarthan forces were strong and overwhelming. It must also be noted that both sides were incredibly secretive with information and often forbade news coverage of any kind on the planet, making the details of this period in Earth-3 history unclear, especially in the leadup to and during the Catastrophe.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">It is believed that human pro-Agarthan forces were conspiring to create a superhuman creature with the help of Hollow Earth entities. the focus of this experiment was a prominent leader in the pro-Agarthan movement, identified only as L. Gibbons. Experiments took place in a North American town formerly known as Farmington.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">It is also believed that Earth-3 forces were engaging in a similar plan with several test subjects. One of these subjects in believed to be the Earth-3 counterpart of <a href='https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/phillip-ball/'>Phillip Ball</a>, while the identities of others have never been concluded on. Some traditions on modern Earth-3 hold that another of the test subjects was the Earth-3 counterpart of Jonathan "Too Decisive" Jones, though this remains to be proven.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">This all culminated in the events of 22 July 2013, known today as the Catastrophe. These events and their date were not forewarned, so almost nothing is known for sure about what happened during the catastrophe. However, tradition holds that on 22 July 2013, both sides executed their experiment, where both L. Gibbons and Phillip became godly beings. They began to battle, whereupon the power involved in the battle killed all life and destroyed everything.<br><br>After the surface of Earth-3 and potentially all of Agartha-3 were reduced to ash and molten rock, the battle moved to Moon-3. Here, Phillip used a weapon given to him by Earth-3 forces now called the Spear of Phillopia by launching it at L. Gibbons, sending him deep into space, never to be seen again. However the thrust of the spear also sent Phillip backwards, whereupon he hurdled into the Sun. Phillip's human body was incinerated, but his life essence combined with the Sun and he became like Phillip Sun. He would then use his powers to bless the Earth with life. Not only would he restore all plant and animal life, but he would create new lifeforms known as the Phils. Phillip Sun specifically created the Phils to be peaceful so that the events on Earth-3 could never be repeated again<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">BCNN investigations are unable to confirm any of these events other than that the Phillip individual's life essence joined with the Sun, creating a being now known as Phillip Sun.<br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-subsection-title">THE NEW EARTH-3 UNDER PHILLIP RULE</div>
			<div class="topic-info"><br>The Phillips of Earth-3 quickly began to form new governments. The first law adopted by all countries was to forbid all non-Phillip entities from stepping foot on the planet. The law specifically forbade all humans, which the Phillips declared as "inherently flawed". Among most non-Phillip scientific groups, the Phillips are regarded as a biological anomoly. Each Phillip has an ability completely unique to themselves. Phillips reproduce through a sort of mitosis procedure, where two new Phillips are produced from the original Phil, with similar (yet unique) abilities. Among the first leaders of Phillips on Earth-3 were Phillip Leader, Phillip Controller, Phillip Governor, and Phillip Dictator (although Phillip Dictator was soon overthrown by Phillip Usurper).<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">It was not long until the discovery of pseudophils was made. In September of 2013, Phillip Publisher published a paper declaring that there were pseudophils on the planet. The paper explained that there was and always would be an equal number of Phillips as pseudophils, and that pseudophils were inferior in every way to Phillips and should be feared. Pandemonium ensued on Earth-3 as Phillips everywhere were afraid that their closest friends may be pseudophils, or that they themselves may be discovered as a pseudophil.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Governments everywhere began declaring new laws directed at the pseudophils. Notable lawmakers such as Phillip Lawmaker and Phillip Law Maker proposed laws for all governments to adopt, such as a jail sentence of at least a year for anyone hiding the fact that they are a pseudophil, making it illegal for pseudophils to conduct business, making it illegal for pseudophils to play games or engage in other fun activities, declaring all pseudophil housing to have at least a certain degree of dilapidation, and criminalizing the existence of pseudophils under certain conditions.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Soon the Phillips and pseudophils became divided across different lines. Today, most pseudophils work as construction workers, farmhands, factory workers, bricklayers, machine operators, street sweepers, sewer cleaners, shovelers, servants, lowly servants, test dummies, and fast-food workers. Many Phillips enjoy comfortable and profitable positions, such as doctor, engineer, surgeon, office worker, consultant, business executor, and business owner. Many pseudophils have held powerful positions disguised as Phillips, only to be later revealed as pseudophils and lose everything. Examples include tech CEO Phillip Keyboard, famous philanthropist Phillip Philanthropist, and progressive politician Phillip Politician. It is estimated that as many as 15% of Phillips are actually pseudophils in disguise.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Earth-3 is also famous for its extremely low murder rates. Most Phillips and Pseudophils believe that killing is wrong, and therefore do not kill other Earth-3 residents. The most recent murder was in 2019, where Phillip Murderer killed Phillip Murdered. A total of 3 murders of Phils by Phils have been recorded on the planet. It must be noted that Phils don't see the killing of non-Phils as murder.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Earth-3 is also notable for the lack of war since its inhabitation by Phils. As Phils believe murder is wrong, they also despise war and avoid it. This precedent was almost broken when Phillip Warmonger became president of North Phillidonia, but he was dissuaded from war by Phillip Peacemaker. Although while conventional wars may be nonexistant on Earth-3, other types of wars rage on in silence, such as the Cyberwar between Technophil LLC (managed by Phillip Software) and Big Technology Phil Ltd. (managed by Phillip Application).<br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-subsection-title">EARTH-3 ON THE INTERGLOBAL STAGE</div>
			<div class="topic-info"><br>Earth-3 is considered by scholars to be the most prosperous and successful Earth, having many successful businesses and institutions. Earth-3 has the highest global GDP, which is due in large part to its large volume of business executives and successful companies in all fields. It is estimated that there isn't a person alive who doesn't benefit from an Earth-3 product or invention in some way. Earth-3 is especially notable for its production of high-end computer parts, its crop production that feeds most of <a href="https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/earth-4/">Earth-4</a>, and its heavy machinery factories.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Despite Earth-3's success, its governments are criticized for their means of production often underminding human rights. Their poor treatment of pseudophil workers and their lack of rights are often sighted as the reason for Earth-3's ability to undercut other producers on the market. While there exists widespread support for pseudophils on many Earths, many have questioned whether or not the pseudophils deserve to be helped or if they deserve more rights. Public debate on pseudophils became widespread after an interview with <a href="https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/phillip-ball/">Phillip Ball</a>, where when asked about the pseudophil's condition, he stated, "What is better for them? To live in a world where they are less than others, or not to live at all?" He refused to elaborate on what this meant for pseudophils.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">There exists no ban on pseudophils entering the territory of any other Earth. Regardless, Phils rarely leave Earth-3 for reasons other than business, often citing their displeasure with non-Phil lifeforms. Tourism from Earth-3 became even less common after the rise of <a href="https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/phillip-ball/">Phillip Ball</a>. Phils found that they could not go anywhere without being mistaken for Phillip Ball, which became a major nuisanse. This mistaking has permeated into the world of social media, and has pushed many Phils to use Phil-exclusive platorms for communication. This problem has resulted in a general comtempt for Phillip Ball across the Earth-3 population, and has begun to have a global impact as Earth-3 politicians suggest preventing selling produce for the purpose of feeding Phillip Ball followers on Earth-4.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">The above examples are commonly cited as some of many reasons for increasing tension between Earth-3 governments and those of other Earths. Another source of strain is the secrecy of Earth-3 officials on many topics, especially on Agartha-3. The Hollow Earth has long been famous for is unique entities and high danger, however its condition has been kept secret by the Earth-3 institutions. Many worry that Agartha-3 is still inhabited by dangerous creatures and fear the Phillip officials are keeping major threats to the public a secret. BCNN investigations have been unable to conclude on the status of Agartha-3.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Despite governmental distrust of Earth-3, the planet of Phils have captivated the non-Phil public. After the Catastrophe, many religions surrounding the Phils (with several also centered around Phillip Ball) were created, holding Earth-3 as a sort of heaven for its followers. Most religions hold that followers will be reincarnated as a Phil, where those who lived a righteous life were reborn as Phillips, while those who lived wickedly came back as pseudophils. The religious movements gained notable support after an interview with <a href="https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/phillip-ball/">Phillip Ball</a> where he stated when asked about the planet, "That's what its all about. To get to Earth-3."<br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-subsection-title">CONCLUSION: WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?</div>
			<div class="topic-info"><br>Earth-3 is a planet that, while often distrusted by governments, is held in high regard by the public and in the corporate sphere. Many believe that it is a paradise formed from the ashes of a ruinous human civilization, despite the societies ill treatment of pseudophils. As a result, when one asks what its all about, its not an uncommon answer to hear, "To get to Earth-3."</div>
