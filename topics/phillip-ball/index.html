			<div class="topic-info"><br>Phillip Ball is an American<sup style="font-size:70%"><span classs='footnote' id='ftnA'onclick="FootNote('ftnA','Though Phillip Ball was born in the United States, he has since renounced his citizenship, stating that no country is good enough to hold Phillip Ball as a citizen');">[a]</span></sup> writer best known for his unpublished work "University of Stone" and his public appearances. Phillip Ball has received praise for his writing ability, with him and his work often becoming the subject of public discussion. Since the start of his writing career, Phillip has held public book readings and given speeches in more than a hundred countries at over a thousand locations, and has appeared on various talk shows and competitions, and has appeared in many television shows, movies, commercials, advertising campaigns, and game shows. Today, he is subject to frequent news coverage and is the subject of countless documentaries depicting both his past and current life.<br><br>
			Phillip himself is best known for his dramatic public appearances. Throughout his career, Phillip has not shied away from the limelight, and has made his opinions <!--Insert links to Phillip making insane statements on each subject here--> on <a href="https://bcnnofficial.github.io/stories/phillip-ball-declares-world-politics-too-complicated/">world politics</a>, <a href="https://bcnnofficial.github.io/stories/phillip-ball-enraged-by-earth-day/">the environment</a>, <a href="https://bcnnofficial.github.io/stories/phillip-ball-outlaws-reading/">other authors</a>, <a href="https://bcnnofficial.github.io/stories/phillip-ball-attempts-to-convert-followers/">religion</a>, personal preferences, himself, and others very clear, often in very visible demonstations of his beliefs. In discussion with others, he has never been known to fear heated debates, and is known for being straightforward, matter-of-fact, and at times agressive during discourse. Through his public appearances, Phillip Ball has gained a strong following; his statements have been known to cause significant sway in public opinion. <br><br>
			To this day, Phillip continues work on his novel. At the start of his career, Phillip lived on Earth-1 and was partnered with the book publisher BCNN Publishing House, where he received funds from preorders. However since then, Phillip has cut ties with BCNN and now intends to self-publish, accepting preorders and donations sent directly to him. He has since moved to Earth-4, where he has gained a significant influence among its residents. With the support of his fans, Phillip Ball plans to finish his book with no expected due date or page count. <br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-subsection-title">THE BEGINNING OF PHILLIP BALL</div>
			<div class="topic-info"><br>Despite Phillip's fame, little is known about his life before he began writing. It is believed that his last name was not always Ball, as counterparts on other Earths do not share this last name. Regardless, he came to be known as Phillip Ball by the start of his writing career. In October 2019 he would sign on to publish with BCNN Publishing House. After a dissapearance, he would sign a contract in April 2020 in regard to what would be his first book, University of Stone.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">The contract detailed the division of revenue, expectations of BCNN and expectations of Phillip Ball. As of the contract's establishment, University of Stone would be open for pre-order. 15% of those profits would go to Phillip unconditionally, while BCNN would use the remainer as funding for advertising and production costs, as well as to generate revenue. In addition to production, BCNN would be responsible for Phillip's advertising campaign and managing his public relations. Phillip was required only to finish his novel, with no required due date or page count. However, Phillip would not be allowed to ask for payment or donations for his book independent of BCNN and its funding.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Through BCNN, Phillip had partnerships with numerous celebrities and corporations, appearing frequently in commercials for recognizable products, hosting popular shows, and making cameos in countless blockbusters. Outside of this, Phillip would hold book readings of his finished prose, which would come to back buildings and draw massive crowds. With funding provided by BCNN, Phillip would also establish himself as a philanthropist, donating large sums to several humanitarian organizations, scholarships funds, and public projects that served the people.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">It wasn't long before Phillip became a household name and an international icon. His book readings, which started out in cramped book stores, came to sell out entire stadiums full of fans waiting to hear the newest updates on his book. Shows and movies that featured him were guaranteed to become commercial succeses with, in many cases, record-breaking numbers. Any public event that involved Phillip would be overwhelmed with Phillip fans. Above all, book sales reached astronomical levels, and Phillip would eventually be named as the <strong>World's Best Selling Author</strong>.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">After Phillip reached international stardom, his public relatios campaign expanded to other planets. Through similar means as used on Earth-1, Phillip Ball was met with overwhelming support on all populated Earths, excluding Earth-3. Despite Phillip Ball being the Earth-1 counterpart to the ancestor for all Phillips and pseudophils on Earth-3, such citizens showed very little interest in Phillip Ball or his book. Eventaully, this disinterest turned into anger as no Earth-3 resident could leave the planet without being mistaken for Phillip Ball, making travel difficult. Aside from this, Phillip Ball received critical acclaim on many other Earths, most notably on Earth-4 where public gathering in the name of Phillip Ball often became violent.<!--MAYBE NAME FIGURES WHO SUPPORTED PHILLIP BALL LIKE MURHESES OHMES OR OTHER--><br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Despite this success, Phillip came to distance himself from BCNN, becoming distrustful. He would organize his own book readings and public appearances independently of BCNN's advisory board. These independent events would often result in injuries, which would grow more numerous and severe over time. By this point too, Phillip gained the endorsement of many political figures, and had signifiant standing with world governments, which helped him to avoid prosecution for various crimes. At times Phillip would also act in an advirosy capacity to governments during intense conflicts and situations.<br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-subsection-title">PHILLIP BALL AND BCNN SPLIT WAYS</div>
			<div class="topic-info"><br>Finally during August of 2021, in a breach of contract, Phillip stated in a public announcement that everyone would receive a copy of his novel, but that Phillip would still accept payment for his novel as well as other donations. Within the announcement, he specified that people must give money diectly to him and not through BCNN. He declared BCNN a corrupt organization that stole his revenue and was hindering the progress of his book through their public relations campaign.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Immediately after Phillip made this announcement, book pre-orders dropped by over 99%. Though Phillip previously enjoyed freedom from prosecution for many of his activities, this was too great of a crime, and warrants were issued for Phillip's arrest so he could face trial for violating his contract. However with the assistance of his supporters, Phillip escaped the planet and traveled to Earth-4, where the population and governments were more supportive of him and hostile towards BCNN.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Quickly, Phillip established himself as a figure of authority on Earth-4, where all other governments and corporations obeyed him by the will of the people. Phillip would condemn those organizations who refused to follow him, and such groups would soon after be dismantled by the local population. Phillip Ball would often make demands of his followers in order to honor him. The most notable of his demands was the building of a mile-tall statue of him, notable due to the irriversible environmental impact the construction effort had.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">By March of 2022, most ecosystems on Earth-4 had been destroyed, leaving nearly inhabitable deserts across the planet. Most of the farmable land had been destroyed and the majority of livestock has perished due to the lack of viable grazing. Almost all of the food on Earth-4 is provided by airdrops from humanitarian organizations on other planets, as well as free deliveries of crops from what farmable land remains (most of these sources of food were destroyed after Phillip's was on the environment). All oceans on Earth-4 also evaporated. Phillip claims responsibility for this event, however there remains no confirmed cause.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Some time in early 2022, Phillip finally established a permanent residence in what was formerly Ohio at an address today known only as "Phillip's House". Beforehand, Phillip would order homes build for him at whatever location he found himself at. Phillip ordered all houses surrounding his for "as far as [he could] see" to be destroyed, and declared this house would be where he'd write his book, and that he will stay there until the book was finished.<br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-subsection-title">PHILLIP BALL IN THE MODERN DAY</div>
			<div class="topic-info"><br>Since his decree, Phillip has remained at "Phillip's House" and has not left sight of it for any reason. Occasionally, he will step out to make an announcement or to attack his fans. Phillip's announcements range from an update on book progress to declaring new laws for everyone on Earth-4 to follow. The frequency of his public appearances varies significantly, sometimes happening several days in a row or with month-long hiatuses.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Since Phillip established his permanent residence, massive crowds of people have surrounded his house at all times, with these crowds constituting the majority of residents on Earth-4. Based on studies conducted by BCNN, people in the crowd are in a perpetual pilgrimage towards Phillip's house, with people pushing past each other and crossing potentially thousands of miles to reach the center of the crowd. As one goes further into the crowd, food becomes very sparse and people become very violent as they fight for what little sustenance there is. Any care packages dropped into the crowd are consumed in moments, though these care packages are dropped frequently. As a result of these factors, Earth-4 is rated as a highly-dangerous planet based on the BCNN safety-scale. Any BCNN reporters assigned to Earth-4 must receive extensive training and are given many resources to protect them.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">The population of the crowd is estimated to be in the billions. Though studies predict that the number of deaths each day is over 3 million on average, the population is believed to be increasing as more come to Earth-4 each day to serve Phillip.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">The impact Phillip and his regime have on the worlds is severe. Due to how many migrate to Earth-4 for Phillip each day (estimated at over 5 million a day), there have been significant drops in population across many Earths, which is equally true for all populations regardless of culture or socioeconomic status. As a result, many countries have placed travel bans to maintain their population, but this is often circumvented by underground smuggling groups who transport people to Earth-4 for a price.<br><br></div>
			<div class="topic-info">Another consequence is food shortages across the Earths. As stated earlier, humanitarian groups have undergone monumental efforts to feed the starving masses on Earth-4, who have no means to feed themselves due to environmental devastation. This has introduced an extremely massive demand for food which has greatly strained the interglobal agricultural industry. While this demand has spawned many new innovations in the field of agriculture, the effort to feed Earth-4 has stolen resources away from other high-need areas, making current humanitaries crises worse and even creating new ones. More information about this issue can be found on the topic page for Earth-4.<br><br><BR><BR></div>
			<div class="topic-subsection-title">FINAL NOTES: WHO IS PHILLIP?</div>
			<div class="topic-info"><br>Phillip Ball is a writer born on Earth-1 who has since achieved unprecedented levels of fame. Though he has the unconditional support of billions and is adored by billions more, he remains a controversial figure in certain ways. Though we can never know what the future holds, it seems Phillip will enjoy his current position for many years to come.<Br><br></div>
