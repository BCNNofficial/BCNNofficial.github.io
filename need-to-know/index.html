		<div class="informers">Since 1998, BCNN has made its core goal to serve the public. Just one of the ways we accomplish this is through our renound, interglobal news coverage stretching across all the Earth(s). Here at BCNN, we report the facts as they are, and we report the facts that all the other guys are too afraid to report.<br><br></div>
