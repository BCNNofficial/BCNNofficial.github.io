1,PHILILP BALL DECLARES WORLD POLITICS TOO COMPLICATED: MUST BE SIMPLIFIED,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BCNNofficial/BCNNofficial.github.io/main/testphoto.jpg,"At 2:34PM, Phillip Standard Time, Phillip Ball stepped out onto the balcony of his house and gazed over the millions surrounding him below. Cheers erupted for miles. It had been weeks since Phillip was seen (somebody spotted him through a window as he walked down the stairs), and even longer since his last announcement. Phillip held one finger to his lips and the crowd slowly silenced across the planet. Everyone here knows better than to make noise during a Phillip announcemnet."
2,PHILILP BALL ENRAGED BY EARTH DAY; DECLARES WAR ON THE ENVIRONMENT,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BCNNofficial/BCNNofficial.github.io/main/testphoto.jpg,"On the 22 of April, Phillip stepped out of his house to applause so thunderous that such had never been seen in the history of man, and this was for good reason. Last time Phillip appeared publicly on his balcony, he announced that when he returned next, he would have an update about his book. Commonly when Phillip gives an update, he only reveals a word at a time. But on the day before this, Phillip announced an update of not just one word. Not just not. Not even just a dependent clause. He was announcing an entire new sentence being added to the book. Such a reveal was unprecedented."
3,PHILILP BALL OUTLAWS READING ON EARTH 4,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BCNNofficial/BCNNofficial.github.io/main/testphoto.jpg,"Early in the morning on the 30 of May, 2024, Phillip was watching the crowds around his house. After the most recent ban on noise was lifted in early March, the crowds were tame and quiet, afraid of another ban if they were to disturb Phillip too much. Slowly, these crowds grew in density and excitement as they started to shout and cheer and bang on the fence surrounding Phillip's house. Occassionally, someone would try to jump the fence and be met with Phillip's wrath, which always excited the crowd more. After Phillip's <a href=""https://bcnnofficial.github.io/phillip-ball-enraged-by-earth-day/"">declaration of war on Earth Day</a>, the crowds thinned out significantly. As of late May, many have returned from their anti-environmental crusade. Things were relatively calm and the crowds haven't yet gained back their full exhilaration."
4,PHILLIP BALL ATTEMPTS TO CONVERT FOLLOWERS TO CHRISTIANITY; DOESN'T WORK,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BCNNofficial/BCNNofficial.github.io/main/testphoto.jpg,"As you may know, Phillip Ball is a devout Christian who believes that Jesus Christ died for our sins. One might think that the same would be true of Phillip's followers on Earth 4, however this is far from the case.<br><br>BCNN recently conducted a poll on Earth 4 asking citizens what their religious affiliation was, if any. Our survey of 3 million residents yielded a large variety of responses, with no single response gaining more than 15% of the sample space (aside from those who chose ""No Religion"", which accounted for 33.5% of responses). Some were polytheistic, some monotheistic. Some had a long and fantastical mythology, while others were based in science. The only unifying factor for all the religions was that they all held Phillip as a god or an otherwise central part of their beliefs."
