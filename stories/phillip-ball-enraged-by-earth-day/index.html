			<div class="story-spacing"><br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">On the 22 of April, Phillip stepped out of his house to applause so thunderous that such had never been seen in the history of man, and this was for good reason. Last time Phillip appeared publicly on his balcony, he announced that when he returned next, he would have an update about his book. Commonly when Phillip gives an update, he only reveals a word at a time. But on the day before this, Phillip announced an update of not just one word. Not just not. Not even just a dependent clause. He was announcing an entire new sentence being added to the book. Such a reveal was unprecedented.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">Perhaps in another time, this day would go down in history as the greatest update in Phillip's book yet. Perhaps in another time, people would celebrate yearly on the 22 of April when Phillip gave such a monumental gift to all of humanity. Children would run around in the streets with paper mache Phillip Ball masks and would speak out the sentence Phillip revealed to them all as parades in Phillip's honor drove down the streets. Perhaps in another time this all could be possible.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">But this time did not come to pass. Unfortunately for us all, today was Earth Day of the year 2024.<br><br></div>
			<div class="ad-div-mobile-instory ads-all"></div><br><br>
			<div class="story-body-text">Phillip held one finger to his lips and silenced the cheering crowd, and soon silence fell over all of Earth 4 as Phillip recalled the sentence in his mind. Then, shouting out to Phillip among the crowd was an environmental activist whose name may never be known. And with this opportunity, the activist asked, "Phillip Ball, what are you doing to protect the environment from the man-made disasters of today?"<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">Phillip paused for just a second, being broken from his trance, and prompty looked down at the activist to proclaim, "I DO NOTHING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, FOR THE ENVIRONMNET HAS DONE NOTHING FOR ME." Phillip returned to remembering the sentence, but suddenly there was something different in the air. The facial expression on Phillip began to become agitated as the silence dragged on. "HOLD ON A SECOND," Phillip demanded, but still only silence passed as Phillip's anger grew. "NO... NO, NO, NO!" Phillip exclaimed to the horror of everyone there. Finally, Phillip unleased a primal scream that was so intense it reached the corners of the globe.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">"I HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY!" screamed Phillip, "I HAVE FORGOTTEN THE SENTENCE!" Shrieks suddenly filled the crown and pandemonium ensued. Phillip cried out over the crowd. "LISTEN HERE, AGENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT. WITH YOUR BOTHERSOME PROBING, YOU HAVE INTERRUPTED MY NATURAL THOUGHT PROCESS AND CAUSED MYSELF TO FORGET THE SENTENCE. YOUR CRIME IS IRREDEEMABLE. FOR YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS, I, PHILLIP BALL, DECLARE WAR ON THE ENVIRONMENT, FOR IT HAS CAUSED ME RUIN. ON THIS DAY, I COMMAND MY FOLLOWERS TO PROLIFERATE THESE MAN-MADE DISASTERS AND DESTROY THE ENVIRONMENT ONCE AND FOR ALL."<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">Immediately, the crowd was filled with a destructive rage. Those surrounding the activist converged, and in that instant any evidence of the activist having ever been on Earth 4 was obliterated completely. Others immediately ran away from Phillip's house to exact their revenge on the environment.<br><br>Phillip only made his decree 8 hours ago as of my writing of this, and already the consequences are profound.<br><br></div>
			<div class="ad-div-mobile-instory ads-all"></div><br><br>
			<div class="story-spacing"><br><br></div>
			<div class="story-subsection-title">CONSEQUENCES: DOMESTIC</div>
			<div class="story-spacing"><br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">Ironically, the effects of Phillip's declaration of war have been minimal on Earth 4. The planet's environment has already seen widespread destruction since the arrival of Phillip Ball. Upon said arrival, many quit their jobs to focus all of their effort on serving P. Ball. At the start, Phillip often made astounding demands of his fans, of such include a giant Phillip Ball statue a kilometer tall, killing all bugs on the planet so they could annoy Phillip no longer, and burning down the world's forests to accelerate global warming so Phillip didn't ever again have to be cold. It is also worth noting that while the oceans of Earth 4 have completely evaporated, it's unclear if this was due to the actions of Phillip Followers or was an act of vengance by Phillip Sun.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">The result is a planet devoid almost completely of life, with deserts covering the globe. Since Phillip's declaration, people have sought out to eliminate any life not already destroyed, block rivers and destroy lakes, and prevent natural life from ever returning to Earth 4. Though the war has just officially started, it seems that Phillip has been fighting this war much longer than he was aware.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-spacing"><br><br></div>
			<div class="story-subsection-title">CONSEQUENCES: INTERGLOBAL</div>
			<div class="story-spacing"><br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">Within these past 8 hours, attacks on the environment have already surfaced, especially on Earth 1 where Phillip's interglobal following is strongest. Governments across the world have already thwarted sabotage attempts on water treatment plans, recycling centers, and renewable energy sources like wind and solar farms.<br><br>The everyday citizen is also taking action, leaving lights on in their homes and keeping appliances plugged in when not used, refusing to recycle, and buying more beef and other meats that fuel the livestock industry and the negative effect it has on the environment. Certain industries have started to benefit from Phillip's declaration as the demand for internationally and non-locally grown foods and non-electric vehicles grows.<br><br>It remains to be seen what the effect of Phillip's war on the environment will have.<br><br></div>
