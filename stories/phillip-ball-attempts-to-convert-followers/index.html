			<div class="story-spacing"><br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">As you may know, Phillip Ball is a devout Christian who believes that Jesus Christ died for our sins. One might think that the same would be true of Phillip's followers on Earth 4, however this is far from the case.<br><br>BCNN recently conducted a poll on Earth 4 asking citizens what their religious affiliation was, if any. Our survey of 3 million residents yielded a large variety of responses, with no single response gaining more than 15% of the sample space (aside from those who chose "No Religion", which accounted for 33.5% of responses). Some were polytheistic, some monotheistic. Some had a long and fantastical mythology, while others were based in science. The only unifying factor for all the religions was that they all held Phillip as a god or an otherwise central part of their beliefs.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">The religion with the largest slice of the pie was Reformed Planetary Ballism at 8.1% of responses (as compared to Fundamental Planetary Ballism with only 0.3% of responses). To summarize, this belief system holds that different versions of Phillip Ball in the past, present, and future are connected spiritually to different celestial objects in the solar system, and that in the era when Phillip Ball finishes his book, he will be spiritually connected with the Sun and become like Phillip Sun. This religion is quickly gaining popularity among the crowds around Phillip's house. It is already three times as big as the next largest religion, Megaball Adventism, and was expected to double in size by the end of the year. Compared to its Fundamentalist counterpart, it has more simplified predictions about past and future eras of Phillip Ball and holds more neutral views on the Pseudophils.<br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="story-subsection-title">PHILLIP LEARNS THE TRUTH</div>
			<div class="story-body-text"><br><br>Weeks after the survey was conducted, BCNN requested an interview with Phillip Ball regarding the results of this survey. Meeting with reporters Kyle Merzer and Jomeranio Mann, the results of the survey were disclosed to Phillip in person. At first, Phillip met the results with indifference, stating, "THEY ARE FOOLS. NOT ONE OF THEM KNOWS THE TRUTH BUT PHILLIP BALL CAN RESPECT THEIR DEVOTION."<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">Reporter Mann, knowing Phillip is a devout Christian, wanted to know how Phillip's personal beliefs conflicted with the survey results. "How do you feel knowing that none of the respondants identified as Christian?" asked Mann, "Many of your followers come from Earth 1, so there is a good chance than many of them were Christian beforehand but renounced their faith."<br><br></div>
			<div class="ad-div-mobile-instory ads-all"></div><br><br>
			<div class="story-body-text">It must be noted that this was among Mann's first assignments on Earth 4, having been a rookie reporter at the First Denver Airport Insurrecions and finding success despite the danger. While Mann was briefed on the danger of the crowds around Phillip's house, Mann had not been adequately briefed on the danger surrounding Phillip Ball himself, partially because BCNN reporters haven't had many interactions with Phillip Ball thus far. However after this incident, BCNN now provides extensive training on how to interact with Phillip Ball for all future reporters assigned to Earth 4.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">After Jomeranio Mann had asked his question, Phillip Ball's demeanor suddenly changed, and a feeling of panic seemed to overwhelm him. Before the reporters could react, Phillip's panic turned to rage and he lashed out at Mann, beating him senselessly. Though both reporters escaped, Mann sustained life-threatening injuries which could not be treated immediately due to the lack of hospitals on Earth 4. Phillip Ball shouted to the crowd to have the reporters killed, however the members of the crowd couldn't identify the reporters and instead turned on their fellow neighbor. Both Mann and Merzer reached the BCNN Position Shifter and translated back to Earth 1. Mann received medical attention and he is expected to possibly recover. Merzer received mild injuries.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">However, as the reporters attempted to escape, Phillip Ball shouted at them, and what he said was later transcribed by the reporters. "I HAVE COMMITTED A GREAT OFFENSE TO YOU LORD," exclaimed Phillip Ball, fists flailing, "I WILL REDEEM MYSELF BY CONVERTING ALL ON THIS PLANET IN YOUR NAME." The reporters were unable to interpret his other screams at this point.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">Thus as a result, BCNN became aware of Phillip's impending attempt to convert his followers to Chirstianity and dispatched uninjured reporters Jummer Jambools and Ashley Trevor immediately despite the incident. I, Kyle Merzer, would join them shortly after when my wounds were judged as not life-threatening.<br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="ad-div-mobile-instory ads-all"></div><br><br>
			<div class="story-subsection-title">THE CONVERSION: WHAT WENT WRONG</div>
			<div class="story-body-text"><br><br>About 5 hours after Phillip's assault against our reporters, he stepped out onto his balcony to applause and cheers. "YOU HAVE ALL BEEN LED ASTRAY, BUT I WILL SHOW YOU THE RIGHTEOUS PATH. IT'S IN THIS BOOK. GOD'S BOOK." He then pulled out a t-shirt cannon and began stuffing Bibles into the cannon, firing them into the crowd. One of these Bibles struck reporter Jummer Jambools in the head, incapacitating him. BCNN has since updated its Phillip Ball training courses to account for such incidences.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">After shooting out about 25 copies of the Bible, he placed down the t-shirt cannon and returned to preaching. "SOME OF YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO SEE ME AS THE LORD OF THIS UNIVERSE," exclaimed Phillip Ball, "BUT WHILE I MAY BE LORD OVER YOU, THERE IS ONLY ONE TRUE LORD, AND HE IS UP THERE!" said Phillip as he pointed into the sky. "SO TELL ME, WHERE IS THE LORD?"<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">Immediately, all in the crowd (except for those fighting over one of the Bibles) pointed at Phillip, much to his displeasure. "NO! NO! I AM NOT THE LORD. I MAY BE ABOVE YOU, BUT NOBODY IS ABOVE HIM. TELL ME! WHO IS THE LORD?"<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">"PHILLIP BALL," shouted the crowd. Philip responded with shouts of rage, then said, "BLASPHEMY. FOOLS. ALL OF YOU." After more shouts of rage, Phillip gathered himself and started again. "I'LL NOW READ THE WORD OF GOD TO YOU." Phillip grabbed a copy of the Bible from the ground and opened it to the first page. He cleared his throat and paused for a second. "'IN THE BEGINNING, GOD-'"<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">"PHILLIP BALL," shouted the crowd, which started to chant his name. Phillip shouted for silence, which partially quieted the crowd. He continued. "'HE CREATED THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH. AND THE EARTH WAS WITHOUT FORM, AND VOID; AND DARKNESS WAS UPON THE FACE OF THE DEEP. AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD-'"<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">"PHILLIP BALL," shouted the crowd, and the chanting resumed. Phillip shouted for silence again but was not able to quiet the crowd this time. At this point, Phillip gave up and left his house to exact his rage against the crowd. It was at this point that our reporters retreated from Earth 4.<br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="ad-div-mobile-instory ads-all"></div><br><br>
			<div class="story-subsection-title">AFTERMATH</div>
			<div class="story-body-text"><br><br>3 days after Phillip preached to the crowd, BCNN conducted another, smaller survey of 200,000 people on Earth 4 once again asking for religious affiliations. Out of those who were asked, all 200,000 responded with the same answer. They declared themselves as Christian, but specified that they believed Phillip Ball was the Lord and ruler over heaven and earth.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">Phillip has since attemped several more conversions of the crowd, however all attempts have ended similarly. It is unlikely that the religious demographics of Earth 4 will change in the near future.<br><br></div>
