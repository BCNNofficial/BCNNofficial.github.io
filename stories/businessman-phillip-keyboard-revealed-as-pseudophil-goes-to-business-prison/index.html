			<div class="story-body-text">Last week, the business world was irreversibly changed when it was announced that Phillip Keyboard was revealed to be a pseudophil. P. Keyboard thought he was in trouble then, facing seizure of his company and jail time of over 30 years. Then, the unthinkable happened: Phillip Keyboard was sent to <a href="https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/business-prison/">Business Prison</a>.<br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="story-subsection-title">BACKGROUND INFO: PHILLIP KEYBOARD</div>
			<div class="story-body-text"><br><br>Phillip Keyboard was a professional businessman of <a href='https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/earth-3/'>Earth-3</a> who rocked the business world with his tech company <em>Phillip Keyboard Industries</em>. He came to exist in 2016 from the division of Phillip Button Panel, creating P. Keyboard and his sibling, Phillip Typewriter. Soon after his creation, he started a company out of the garage of his home in Paris, Phrance, where he built keyboards out of various materials he found. His company was immediately popular with locals, but at the time P. Keyboard had no desire to expand outside of his home town. As a result, <em>Phillip Keyboard Industries</em> became a staple of Paris, and tourists would come from throughout Earth-3 to look at P. Keyboard's keyboard selection and possliby order a keyboard for themselves.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">Then, in 2019, Phillip Keyboard got the big break he never asked for. Throughout 2019, the Youtuber known as Phillip Keyboard Reviewer was doing a special series where he toured through Phrance, stopping at towns, judging their keyboard selection, and testing their wares. P. Keyboard Reviewer's tour eventally took him to Paris, where he stopped by <em>Phillip Keyboard Industries</em>. P. Keyboard Reviewer immediately remarked that the idea of P. Keyboard's company was idiotic, and decided to order a water keyboard (rather than an ice keyboard) to show how dumb of an idea the company was.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">Phillip Keyboard Reviewer didn't actually expect to receive a keyboard, but just 3 hours later while at a tech shop, the Youtuber received a delivery for a hand-made Water Keyboard. To P. Keyboard Reviewer's surprise, it not only wored, but worked flawlessly. P. Keyboard invented new technology that was dissolvable and kept globs of water together in the shape of keys, which would act like a quasi-gelatenous substance and send electronic signals when touched. P. Keyboard Reviewer tried to destroy the keyboard, but all his attempts simply displaced the water, which would eventaully re-coalesce into its keyboard shape. Phillip Keyboard Reviewer declared the Water Keyboard the best keyboard he has ever used, and concluded his review by drinking the keyboard.<sup style="font-size:70%"><span classs='footnote' id='ftna'onclick="FootNote('ftn1','Phillip Keyboard Industries warns against drinking water from Water Keyboards, as it is likely to result in keyboardification.');">[a]</span></sup><br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">This video quickly went viral, and made Phillip Keyboard an interglobal icon. Orders were mailed to him from across the Earths, and soon Phillip Keyboard had over a million keyboards to make. For a time, P. Keyboard considered refusing mail-in orders or abandoning his company entirely, but eventually Phillip Keyboard decided he'd rise to the challenge. He would soon take out a 1,000 NO. Coin loan and purchase factories all across Earth-3. He'd draft up all the designs for the keyboard-making machines and would build some of the machines himself. Using these machines, he'd fulfill his keyboard demands, handcrafting some especially difficult requests. Phillip Keyboard received seemingly impossible demands, such as a living keyboard, a keyboard smaller than an atom, and an Antimatter Keyboard, but all requests were met. Payment was demanded in advance.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text"><em>Phillip Keyboard Industries</em> began to corner the market and by 2022, it was the leading keyboard manufacturer, with Phillip Keyboard gaining a net worth of hundreds of billions of dollars. It was predicted that, if fate didn't take its course, Phillip  Keyboard would have become a trillionaire by 2026 and gained a near-monopoly over the keyboard industry by 2030. Businesspeople from around the worlds praised Phillip Keyboard for his innovative business tactics and competitive practices, and he received several awards within and outside of Earth-3. It seemed certain that Phillip Keyboard would go down in business history as a legend.<br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="story-subsection-title">PHILLIP KEYBOARD THE PSEUDOPHIL LOSES EVERYTHING</div>
			<div class="story-body-text"><br><br>In the early morning of 27 June 2024, the leading expert on pseudophil identification Phillip Publisher published a paper declaring another list of people he found to be pseudophils. However this list had only a single name on it, and it was the name of Phillip Keyboard.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">For our readers who are not aware, there exists two types of Phils on Earth-3: Phillips and pseudophils. Phillips on Earth-3 enjoy the highest living standards among any group across the Earths and are often in positions of power. On the other hand, pseudophils are an oppressed group often seen as lesser among Phillips, and there exist many laws that limit their rights. Among the most known of these laws is titled "ANTI-PSEUDOPHIL LAW 3", which states that no pseudophil may conduct business. This law is recognized by all countries on Earth-3.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">Phillip Keyboard undoubtedly conducted business, and the punishments he was facing were severe. When the news broke, he was in the middle of a hiking retreat in the wilderness of Turkphilistan. Court proceedings required him to be in Paris so he attempted to charter a flight home. Unfortunately due to his new pseudophil status, airlines were legally barred from selling a ticket to him, as he was now considered a phlight risk by all airlines and airplanes. Phillip Keyboard also tried to establish contact with his legal team, led by the renound Phillip Lawyer. Unfortunately, his entire legal team abandoned him, stating their displeasuer at having worked with a pseudophil this entire time.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">At this point, P. Keyboard's only move was to transfer control of his company before it was siezed and dismantled by the government of Phrance. Once again, many refused to even listen to him due to his new pseudophil status. P. Keyboard briefly considered transferring the company to his pair Phillip Typewriter, but decided it would be better to let the company be destroyed as P. Typewriter "couldn't manage a fortified hot dog stand on <a href='https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/earth-4/'>Earth-4</a> if his life depended on it," according to P. Keyboard in one interview.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">In the end, the consequences of being a pseudophil would become the least of his problems. As he was running across the Eurasian continent in an attempt to get back to Paris while being pursued by a band of pseudophil-antagonizers, he suddenly ceased to exist in his current position. It is unknown if Phillip Keyboard was expecting this outcome or if it came as a surprise, but later that day, a mass email would be sent to all conductors of business. It declared that Phillip Keyboard was now a prisoner in <a href='https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/business-prison/'>Business Prison</a>.<br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="story-subsection-title">THE CURRENT SITUATION; LIFE IN BUSINESS PRISON</div>
			<div class="story-body-text"><br><br>Though only a couple days have passed since the vanishing of Phillip Keyboard, both <a href='https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/business-prison/'>Business Prison</a> and the world outside have been changed forever.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">By the time our Business Prison reporters found Phillip Keyboard earlier this day, he had already made a name for himself. Within Business Prison, there exists different ranks of prisoners, with higher ranks offering more privileges as well as responsibilities. It often takes months before a prisoner is even considered for a promotion by Business Prison administrators, and most prisoners fail to receive their promotion and higher rank. It takes commonly over a decade before prisoners receive promotion to "executive" ranks that involve managing other prisoners, if they ever get that far. But in spite of all this, P. Keyboard has already been raised to the third rank, and is being considered for a promotion to executive duties.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">"His drive and his work ethic are like nothing I've ever seen," remarked Martha Piedmont, a prisoner who often worked in the vicinity of Phillip Keyboard. "I was being considered for my first promotion when Phillip Keyboard arrived, and already I knew I was in trouble. He finished his duties at an unprecedented rate, and at an unprecedented quality. He received the email that he was being considered by his first lunch break, and by his second, he had the promotion. I want to be angry, but really I'm just in awe."<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">Though not all hold such positive opinions of P. Keyboard. The pseudophil business mogul claims that there have already been several attempts on his life, most of which he defeated easily. "Quite frankly, I'm used to attempts on my life," said Phillip Keyboard in an interview with BCNN reporters, "the Keyboard industry is a lot more fierce than you'd expect." P. Keyboard was unable to talk for long, as he was in the middle of preparing for a conference he hopes will put him in the executive spot.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">Things are not as grand outside of the business penitentiary. By Earth-3 law, if one Phillip becomes unable to manage his property, his closest Phillip will take ownership. As Earth-3 governments could not complete proceedings to dismantle P. Keyboard's empire before he was sent to Business Prison, ownership of <em>Phillip Keyboard Industries</em> was transferred to Phillip Keyboard's closest relative, Phillip Typewriter, who renamed the company <em>Phillip Typewriter Industries</em>. <br><br>In a controversial decision, P. Typewriter decided to cancel all orders for keyboards and shift the company focus to producing hand-made vintage typewriters. What few people who put in orders for their own typewriter have all been left dissapointed by the lackluster quality, if they ever received a typewriter at all. "I really have no idea what I'm doing," said Phillip Typewriter in a press conference this afternoon before stepping away.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">As a result of this, a massive power vacuum remains in the keyboard industry market. When reporters asked Phillip Keyboard who he thought would step up to fill the hole he'd left behind, he said only, "Nobody can know, but whatever happens next, it will be bloody."</div>
