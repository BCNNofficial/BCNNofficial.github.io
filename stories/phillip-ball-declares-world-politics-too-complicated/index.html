			<div class="story-image-and-caption"><img class="story-body-image" src="phillip wisdom.jpg" alt="photo"><div class="story-image-caption">Phillip Ball has long been praised for his wisdom in all matters, and now he gives wisdom on world politics.<sup style="font-size:70%"><span classs='footnote' id='ftn1'onclick="FootNote('ftn1','IMAGE SOURCES: https\:\/\/pixabay.com/photos/crowd-of-people-crowd-football-fans-1488213/ https://pixabay.com/photos/desert-sand-dunes-dunes-dry-1270345/ https://pixabay.com/photos/wall-castle-balcony-sky-view-343468/');">[1]</span></sup></div></div>
			<div class="story-spacing"><br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">At 2:34PM, Phillip Standard Time, Phillip Ball stepped out onto the balcony of his house and gazed over the millions surrounding him below. Cheers erupted for miles. It had been weeks since Phillip was seen (somebody spotted him through a window as he walked down the stairs), and even longer since his last announcement. Phillip held one finger to his lips and the crowd slowly silenced across the planet. Everyone here knows better than to make noise during a Phillip announcemnet.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">Everyone was holding their breath. At last, Phillip spoke.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">"AS YOU ALL KNOW," Phillip shouted across the crowd, "THE WORLD OUTSIDE THIS WORLD IS A RUINOUS PLACE. FULL OF MISERY AND DEVASTATION AND RUIN. FOR YEARS, THE GREATEST MINDS HAVE WONDERED ABOUT HOW WE GOT HERE, AND WHY WE HAVE DOOMED OURSELVES TO LIVE IN SUCH A STATE. BUT NO ANSWER HAS BEEN FOUND, BECAUSE I HADN'T YET THOUGHT OF THE ANSWER."<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">Phillip paused for a couple seconds as he gripped the wooden railing on his balcony. "THE WORLD IS TOO COMPLICATED. HOW CAN WE EVER FEED THE POOR, END WAR FOREVER, AND CREATE WORLD PEACE WITH ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES?. WITH ALL OF THESE FACTIONS, COALITIONS, ORGANIZATIONS... IT'S TOO MUCH FOR ANY COMMON MAN TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION. WHILE I HAVE SEVERAL SOLUTIONS, THESE SOLUTIONS ARE JUST AS COMPLICATED AS THE STATE OF THE WORLD, AND THUS CAN'T BE UNDERSTOOD. THE ONLY ANSWER IS TO SIMPLIFY THINGS."<br><br></div>	
			<div class="story-body-text">Phillip proceeded to explain how world politics may be simplified. His solutions included: limiting the amount of countries per planet to 12, only allowing 2 different "sides" per planet (one for the good guys, and one for the bad guys), and requiring a form before declaring war listing motivations (chosen from multiple choices), expectations, goals, and enemies. Phillip declared that if these simple measures are implemented, then the world would quickly become peaceful and an optimal place to live. Phillip also stated that limiting the population of each planet to 5 million would also likely result in peace, but should be avoided as it may constitute genocide and would be bad for book sales.<br><br></div>

			<div class="story-subsection-title">INTERNATIONAL REACTIONS</div>
			<div class="story-spacing"><br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">While the public reaction to Phillip's declaration has been positive, international government reactions have been surprisingly muted. However, our BCNN governmental sources reveal that there is a great deal of chatter behind closed doors. <br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">Sources on Earth 1 reveal that secret meetings are being held, discuessing the logistics behind making Phillip's plan a reality. Countries are already considering how they want to merge with each other to form one of the twelve countries, whether they want to join the "good guys" or "bad guys" side, and scheduling out prospective wars.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">The logistics of pulling off such a transition would be tricky, so it remains to be seen if anything will come of Phillip's declaration.<br><br></div>
