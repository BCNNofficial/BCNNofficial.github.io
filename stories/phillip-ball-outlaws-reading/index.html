			<div class="story-spacing"><br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">Early in the morning on the 30 of May, 2024, Phillip was watching the crowds around his house. After the most recent ban on noise was lifted in early March, the crowds were tame and quiet, afraid of another ban if they were to disturb Phillip too much. Slowly, these crowds grew in density and excitement as they started to shout and cheer and bang on the fence surrounding Phillip's house. Occassionally, someone would try to jump the fence and be met with Phillip's wrath, which always excited the crowd more. After Phillip's <a href="https://bcnnofficial.github.io/phillip-ball-enraged-by-earth-day/">declaration of war on Earth Day</a>, the crowds thinned out significantly. As of late May, many have returned from their anti-environmental crusade. Things were relatively calm and the crowds haven't yet gained back their full exhilaration.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">It was these moments of calmness that afforded one individual, later identified as Naomi Orduran, a chance to read. She happen to be reading a book called <a href="https://loriwilde.com/the-cowboy-and-the-princess/">The Cowboy and the Princess" by Lori Wilde</a> when Phillip spotted her. Immediately, Phillip put away his pocket telescope, left his house, and marched over to this individual.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">Phillip had an enraged look on his face as he left his home, leaving all with a petrified feeling, especially Ms. Orduran as Phillip directed his stride directly for her book. Immediately, Phillip stole the book from her hands and analyzed it, turning it over in his hand as he stared at it with an inquisitive look. Then, Phillip threw the book out into the crowd and cleared his throat for an announcement.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">"IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION", stated Phillip Ball boldly, "THAT SOME PEOPLE HERE HAVE BEEN INDULING IN BOOKS THAT ARE NOT OF MY CREATION. THIS IS A GRAVE OFFENSE, BUT ONE I AM WILLING TO FORGIVE, AS I HAVE NOT TOLD YOU OF THIS SIN BEFORE."<br><br>He continued, "IF YOU ARE TO WALK IN THE WAY OF PHILLIP BALL, THEN YOUR BODY MUST BE A TEMPLE. YOU MUST MIND WHAT ENTERS THIS TEMPLE. THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULD EAT WHAT IS CORRECT, DRINK WHAT IS CORRECT, AND THINK WHAT IS CORRECT. LIKE FOOD AND WATER AND THOUGHTS, IF THE MEDIA YOU CONSUME IS NOT RIGHT IN THE EYES OF PHILLIP, THEN YOUR TEMPLE WILL BECOME CORRUPTED AND YOU CANNOT POSSIBLY WALK IN THE WAY OF PHILLIP BALL."<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">"THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT NO BOOK HOLDS WHAT IS CORRECT. BUT IT IS NECESSARY THAT NO BOOK HOLDS ALL THAT IS CORRECT AND ONLY WHAT IS CORRECT. IF IT DID, THEN IT WOULD BE OF MY OWN WORDS. AND I HAVE NOT FINISHED BY BOOK." Phillip paused for a moment as if to ready himself. "THEREFORE, SINCE NO BOOK CAN BE CORRECT IN THE EYES OF PHILLIP, THEN NO WRITTEN BOOK'S WORDS SHALL EVER ENTER YOUR TEMPLE. THEREFORE," said Phillip as he pointed out into the crowd, "TO PREVENT SUCH AN ATROCITY, I FORMALLY OUTLAW READING ON THIS PLANET."<br><br><br><br></div>
			<div class="story-subsection-title">WHAT THIS MEANS</div>
			<div class="story-body-text"><br><br>Phillip Ball then elaborated on the consequences of this declaration, first explaining what it means to "outlaw reading". He explained that it would be sufficient to convict someone of reading if they are seen holding a book or otherwise having a book on their person. The consequence of this would be death on the spot, similar to the consequences of most other crimes on Earth 4. Phillip Ball acknowledged that this could potentially lead to people being falsely accused and killed if a book was planted on a person, but Phillip stated he trusted that none of his followers would abuse this law for their own personal gain.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">Phillip also elaborated on what constituted a "book". He explanied that since the law was meant to prevent people's minds from being corrupted with non-Phillip ideas, anything that conveys information through written word would be considered a book. This included not only novels, but magazines, newspapers, editorials, social media posts, posters, signs, billboards, and essentially anything with words in or on it.<br><br></div>
			<div class="ad-div-mobile-instory ads-all"></div><br><br>
			<div class="story-body-text">Finally, Phillip shed light on how people can best follow this new law. He stated that since nothing but his unpublished book was meant to be read, it would be best to forget how to read in the mean time. Phillip followed up by stating that he would let everyone know when it was time to learn how to read again in preparation for his book once it was close to publishing time.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text">Phillip also declared that it would be in everyone's best interest if all books were destroyed as well to prevent them from being read. To conclude his speech, Phillip sent out his followers across the planet on another crucade to eliminate the written word from this world. Our BCNN experts predict that it will take around 11 days for his followers to successfully destroy every book on Earth 4, excluding those books in Phillip's house. Phillip also stated that he is immune from the rule as he is wise enough to know what is and isn't correct in the eye's of Phillip.<br><br></div>
			<div class="story-body-text"><strong>UPDATE: </strong>On the 2 of June, 2024, it was brought to Phillip's attention that by banning all books, he had inadvertently banned The Bible and sentenced all copies of The Bible to be destroyed. Phillip, being a devout Christian, regretted this oversight immediately. He sent out an update among his followers that The Bible was exemt from this rule, and later prayed for forgiveness to The Lord for banning His book and for any copies of The Bible that happened to be destroyed.<br><br></div>
