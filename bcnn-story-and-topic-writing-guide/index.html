    <div class="big-subheader">Stories and Topic Pages</div>
    <div class="body-text">On behalf of our Company President <strong>Dog</strong> and Company Vice President <strong>Paul Allen</strong>, welcome to the BCNN team!</div>
    <div class="our-image-and-caption">
        <img class="our-image" src="images/Untitled_Artwork-2.png">
        <div class="our-caption">President <strong>Dog</strong> and Vice President <strong>Paul Allen</strong></div>
    </div>
    <div class="body-text">We know that as BCNN journalists, you'll be dedicating all your time towards stellar coverage and reporting. Thus once you've created your story, we want to streamline the process of getting your creation up as much as possible.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Thus, this guide will be dedicated towards showing you all the steps necessary to go from a written story to a finished product proudly displayed for all to see. We know that you'll uphold BCNN's standards for quality.</div>
    <div class="body-text">If you have any questions, or if any problems come up while you are following this process, don't be too afraid to contact your designated supervisor. Additionally you can contact the BCNN Writing Assistance Office at <strong>505-555-9891</strong> or email them at <strong>BCNN-WAO@bcnn.com</strong>.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Without further delay, we introduce the Official Writing and Uploading Guide of BCNN.</div>
	<div class="main-header">STEP 1: WRITE THE STORY</div>
    <div class="body-text">Before you can upload a story, you have to write the story. However while we have no desire to tell you how to do your job to complete excellence, there are somethings to consider before you start uploading your work.</div>
    <div class="little-header">Story: Topics covered</div>
    <div class="body-text">What topics do your story cover? Often, a story may cover a single or multiple topics. While this shouldn't affect the writing process, it's something to keep in mind for later.</div>
    <div class="little-header">Title</div>
    <div class="body-text">Of course, a story or a topic page needs a title.</div>
    <div class="little-header">Story: Author</div>
    <div class="body-text">All reporters are allowed to write under any name they want. They can change this name between stories if they so wish.</div>
    <div class="little-header">Story: Date</div>
    <div class="body-text">When was this story published and uploaded? <em>When do you want it to be published?</em></div>
    <div class="little-header">Sub-header</div>
    <div class="body-text">Sub-header can be used to section off the story into chunks. If you choose to use these, then this BCNN system has support for them.</div>
    <div class="body-text">There are some other things to consider as well.</div>
    <div class="little-header">Images</div>
    <div class="body-text">This system does have support for images, however the process for adding images into a story is slightly more complicated. We will cover it later on in this guide.</div>
    <div class="little-header">Bold and Italic</div>
    <div class="body-text">This system offers support for bolding and italicizing text, however it's a bit more complicated than just pasting bold or italic text into the Google Sheets document. If you want to bold or italicize anything, use the following format:</div>
    <div class="code-text">&lt;strong&gt;Text here is bolded&lt;/strong&gt;<br>&lt;em&gt;Text here is italicized&lt;/em&gt;</div>
    <div class="body-text">So you must surround your bolded or italicized text with the correct tags. So for example, if I want to write the following sentence:</div>
    <div class="body-text">While he asked for a <em>large volume</em> of University of Stone copies, Phillip Ball demanded he would have <strong>one large copy of University of Stone</strong>, volume one.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Then I would need to write the following in my story:</div>
    <div class="code-text">While he asked for a &lt;em&gt;large volume&lt;/em&gt; of University of Stone copies, Phillip Ball demanded he would have &lt;strong&gt;one large copy of University of Stone&lt;/strong&gt;, volume one.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Additional tags can be found at this link: <a href='https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-tags-a-to-z-list/'>https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-tags-a-to-z-list/</a>. It should be noted that any HTML text interset into the story will be treated as HTML when processed into the story. This can potentially be used for creating many things, including bulleted lists, tables, and more.</div>
    <div class="little-header">Links</div>
    <div class="body-text">Links are a great way to immediately connect readers to important pieces of information related to the story. This is done through the use of tags. If you want to include a link, use the following format in your story:</div>
    <div class="code-text">&lt;a href='[INSERT LINK TO PAGE HERE]'&gt;[TEXT WITH LINK HERE]&lt;/a&gt;</div>
    <div class="body-text">In the [INSERT LINK TO PAGE HERE] section, paste in the link that the reader will be sent to when the link is clicked. You can put anything in the [TEXT WITH LINK HERE] section; it will become blue/purple and will send users to the link when clicked.</div>
    <div class="body-text">As an example, let's say I wanted to write the following text:</div>
    <div class="body-text"><a href='https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/phillip-ball/'>Phillip Ball</a> has established de facto control over all of <a href='https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/earth-4/'>Earth-4</a>.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Then I would need to write the following text into my story:</div>
    <div class="code-text">&lt;a href='https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/phillip-ball/'&gt;Phillip Ball&lt;/a&gt; has established de facto control over all of &lt;a href='https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/earth-4/'&gt;Earth-4&lt;/a&gt;.</div>
    <div class="little-header">Footnotes</div>
    <div class="body-text">This system also has support for footnotes. To add a footnote into a story, paste the following code straight into your story immediately after the word you want to be footnoted.</div>
    <div class="code-text">&lt;sup style="font-size:70%"&gt;&lt;span class='footnote' id='[ID HERE]'onclick="FootNote('[ID HERE]','[TEXT IN FOOTNOTE HERE]');"&gt;[a]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;</div>
    <div class="body-text">This allows you to add footnotes anywhere in your story, like so<sup style="font-size:70%"><span class='footnote' id='ftnA'onclick="FootNote('ftnA','This is the text inside of a footnote.');">[a]</span></sup>.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Some things to note are the [ID HERE] and [TEXT IN FOOTNOTE HERE] sections. The latter is pretty straightforward; it is where you put the text you want to pop up when the footnote is clicked. If you want apostrophes in the footnote text, type " \' " rather than " ' " (without the quotes; must be a backslash, not /). Currently, this system does not allow for quotation marks in the footnote text; we apologize for this inconvinience. The [ID HERE] section is a unique identifier that the footnote needs to work. It must be a word without spaces, quotation marks, or apostrophes, and each footnote needs a different id.</div>
    <div class="body-text">As an example, if I wanted to write the following text:</div>
    <div class="body-text">Phillip Murderer<sup style="font-size:70%"><span class='footnote' id='ftnB'onclick="FootNote('ftnB','Not to be confused with Phillip Murder.');">[b]</span></sup>, wanted for the murder of Phillip Victim<sup style="font-size:70%"><span class='footnote' id='ftnC'onclick="FootNote('ftnC','Not to be confused with Phillip Murdered, who was killed by Phillip Murder.');">[c]</span></sup>, has finally been caught and executed on the spot.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Then I would need to write the following in my story:</div>
    <div class="code-text">Phillip Murderer<strong>&lt;sup style="font-size:70%"&gt;&lt;span class='footnote' id='<em>ftnB</em>'onclick="FootNote('<em>ftnB</em>','<em>Not to be confused with Phillip Murder.</em>');"&gt;[b]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;</strong>, wanted for the murder of Phillip Victim<strong>&lt;sup style="font-size:70%"&gt;&lt;span class='footnote' id='<em>ftnC</em>'onclick="FootNote('<em>ftnC</em>','<em>Not to be confused with Phillip Murdered, who was killed by Phillip Murder.</em>');"&gt;[c]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;</strong>, has finally been caught and executed on the spot.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Of course if you are having difficulty adding footnotes or anything into your story, then feel free to reach out to our Writing Assistnace Office.</div>
    <div class="main-header">STEP 2: EDIT STORY INTO GOOGLE SHEETS DOCUMENT</div>
    <div class="body-text">For our system to work, it needs a little bit of help. Below are instructions for how to parse your story into the Google Sheets document so it can be converted into a site correctly.</div>
    <div class="body-text">The systems are slightly different depending on if you're making a story or a topic page, so follow the instructions as necessary.</div>
    <div class="med-header">FOR A STORY</div>
    <div class="body-text">To upload a story, it must be inserted into <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18UsYDlaHZrCuIUt9FOMiU6zP7se5EVXjsHgttUDXzIs/edit?gid=0#gid=0'>this Google Sheets document</a>.</div>
    <div class="body-text">If you are creating a new story, then you must make a new sheet: click on the plus icon in the bottom right corner.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/1.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">You can name the page whatever you want (don't use quotation marks). You'll need the <strong>story sheet name</strong> later on.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Now you'll want to set up your sheet as follows:</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/2.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">For the id row, you will start at 1 and count up as you go on.</div>
    <div class="little-header">TOPICS</div>
    <div class="body-text">First, you'll need to specify which topics, if any, your story is connected to.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/3.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Under info1, type in "TOPIC" (must be all caps). Under info2, type in the name of the topic. Under info3, insert the link to the topic page if one exists for it.</div>
    <div class="body-text">You can have as many, or as little, topics in your story as you want. However it's advisable to insert them before anything else.</div>
    <div class="little-header">TITLE</div>
    <div class="body-text">This is where you insert the title of your story.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/4.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Under info1, type in "TITLE". Under info2, add your title. Most titles are in all caps, but this is not required.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Note that until we start adding paragraphs, the order in which these are added matters. The website may not be created in the right order if things are not added in the demonstrated order.</div>
    <div class="little-header">AUTHOR, DATE</div>
    <div class="body-text">Stories commonly contain a listed author and the date they were published.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/5.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Under info1, enter "AUTHOR" and "TITLE". Under info2, enter the author of the story and the time and date of publication.</div>
    <div class="little-header">IMAGE</div>
    <div class="body-text">At this point, imgages, subheaders, and paragraphs can be added in any order. However it may be preferrable to start off your story with an image.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/6.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">To add an image, under info1, type "IMAGE".</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under info2, type in the file name for the image. For example, in this case the file name is "phillip wisdom.jpg".</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under info3, type in the alt text for the image. This is just the text that appears when the image doesn't load correctly.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under info4, type in the caption for the image. This text will appear under the image on the story page.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under info5, add any additional information about the image; a footnote will be created which will display this information when clicked (you don't need to add the footnote yourself). Add information here about image sources, if the image is AI generated, etc. Make sure you are licensed to use anything that appears in the image, and give attribution when necessary. Some media may have a creative commons license, but may legally require attribution or may not allow for derivative works.</div>
    <div class="body-text">If you have nothing you'd like to be in info5, type "NONE" in all caps.</div>
    <div class="little-header">PARAGRAPHS</div>
    <div class="body-text">Each paragraph of your story must be added separately.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/7.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Under info1, type "PG". Under info2, paste the contents directly into the cell. Keep in mind that any formatting you do yourself will be ignored, and only the formatting that the system will recognize is detailed above in Part 1.</div>
    <div class="little-header">SUBHEADERS</div>
    <div class="body-text">Subheaders refer to smaller titles that can section a story into pieces.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/8.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Under info1, type "ST". Under info2, paste in the text of the subheader.</div>
    <div class="little-header">COMMENT SECTION</div>
    <div class="body-text">Many BCNN stories include a sort-of comment section that can be accessed at the bottom of the page.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/9.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Under info1, type "COMSEC". Under info2, paste the link to the comment section.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Now that's all grand, but how to we create a comment section for this story?</div>
    <div class="body-text">First, make sure you are logged into the official BCNN Google account. If you don't have access to this account, contact the Writing Assistnace Office.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Then, find "Blogger" in the collection of apps.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/10.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Then, create a new blog post.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/11.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Design the post however you want; what's important is that when the post is published, a comment section will appear at the bottom of the page. Click publish when done.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/12.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">To go to the blog page, click on the view icon.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/13.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Then finally, copy the link.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/14.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Honestly this system is pretty horrible so if you have any better ideas, go for it. You just need to post a link to it under info2. But you can use anything at all which would act as a comment section. Doesn't have to be connected to Google or anything.</div>
    <div class="med-header">FOR A TOPIC PAGE</div>
    <div class="body-text">To instead upload a topic page, you need to insert the material into <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hVT3Q3RC_oM9nCJ3mKtcud53qSeJvIbZgvG-r7C3piM/edit?gid=1804419893#gid=1804419893'>this Google Sheets Page</a>.</div>
    <div class="body-text">If you are creating a new story, then you must make a new sheet: click on the plus icon in the bottom right corner.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/15.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">You can name the page whatever you want (don't use quotation marks). You'll need the <strong>story sheet name</strong> later on.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Now you'll want to set up your sheet as follows:</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/16.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">For the id row, you will start at 1 and count up as you go on.</div>
    <div class="little-header">TITLE</div>
    <div class="body-text">Every topic page needs a title for the topic.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/17.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Under info1, type in "TITLE". Under info2, add your title. Most titles are in all caps, but this is not required.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Note that until we start adding paragraphs, the order in which these are added matters. The website may not be created in the right order if things are not added in the demonstrated order.</div>
    <div class="little-header">NOTE</div>
    <div class="body-text">Sometimes you want to get the facts straight before the page even begins. Adding a note is optional. It will appear directly underneath the title.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/18.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">First, under info1 type "NOTE". Under info2, add the note you'd like to appear on the page.</div>
    <div class="little-header">BODYSTART</div>
    <div class="body-text">This tag is only for the sake of keeping the system running. All you have to do is add "BODYSTART" under info1 after NOTE if there is a note, or after TITLE if there is no note.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/19.png"></div>
    <div class="little-header">IMAGE</div>
    <div class="body-text">Commonly, you may want to start off your page with an image. Below are instructions for that, however these instructions are also valid once you are in the body of the topic page with the paragraphs and subheaders.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/20.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">To add an image, under info1, type "IMAGE".</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under info2, type in the file name for the image. For example, in this case the file name is "phillip ball.jpg".</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under info3, type in the alt text for the image. This is just the text that appears when the image doesn't load correctly.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under info4, type in the caption for the image. This text will appear under the image on the story page.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under info5, add any additional information about the image; a footnote will be created which will display this information when clicked (you don't need to add the footnote yourself). Add information here about image sources, if the image is AI generated, etc. Make sure you are licensed to use anything that appears in the image, and give attribution when necessary. Some media may have a creative commons license, but may legally require attribution or may not allow for derivative works.</div>
    <div class="body-text">If you have nothing you'd like to be in info5, type "NONE" in all caps.</div>
    <div class="little-header">TABLE</div>
    <div class="body-text">For many topic pages, there is a table with quick facts for the immediate pleasure of the audience. Below is an example of such:</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/21.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Below shows everything you need to enter in to create a table.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/22.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">First, enter under info1 "TABLESTART" so the system can create the base of the table.</div>
    <div class="body-text">To add a new row in the table, enter under info1 "TABLE", enter under info2 what you want to be in the left column, and enter under info3 what you want to be under the right column.</div>
    <div class="body-text">When you are done adding rows, you can finish the table by typing "BREAK" under info1.</div>
    <div class="little-header">PARAGRAPHS</div>
    <div class="body-text">Now the body of the paper begins. Images can be addded here as well. Each paragraph of your topic page must be added separately.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/23.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Under info1, type "PG". Under info2, paste the contents directly into the cell. Keep in mind that any formatting you do yourself will be ignored, and only the formatting that the system will recognize is detailed above in Part 1.</div>
    <div class="little-header">SUBHEADERS</div>
    <div class="body-text">Subheaders refer to smaller titles that can section a topic page into pieces.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/24.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Under info1, type "ST". Under info2, paste in the text of the subheader.</div>
    <div class="body-text">At this point there is nothing else to do. Once you have addedd everything you want to, we can move on to the next step.</div>
    <div class="main-header">STEP 3: SET UP STORY FOR GITHUB</div>
    <div class="body-text">Though not the last step entirely, this is the last step until your story is created and live on BCNN. The process for adding a story versus adding a topic page is slightly different, so follow directions as necessary.</div>
    <div class="med-header">FOR A STORY</div>
    <div class="body-text">You will need access to the BCNN github page for the following. If you do not have access, please contact the Writing Assistance Office.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Within the "stories" folder, there should be another folder called "template", with a file in it called "index.html". Open that file and copy all of the text inside of it.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/25.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Next, go back to the stories folder. While inside of this folder, click on "Add file" in the top-right corner, then click on "Create new file".</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/26.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">At the top, you will be asked to add a name for the file. Your file name will be "[name of folder]/index.html".</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/27.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">In this case, I typed in "sample/index.html". This makes a folder inside of the "directories" folder, and creates the index.html file inside of that folder. You can name the folder whatever you want, but keep in mind that whatever you name that folder, it will become part of the page URL. For example, this story will have the link "https://bcnnofficial.github.io/stories/sample/". You create the folder when you type in the forward slash. Keep in mind the file name must be index.html, or the site won't work.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Next, paste in all the code from the template.</div>
    <div style="width:800px;" class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="800px" src="images/28.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">When you first paste it in, under &lt;script&gt;, it should read <strong>GenerateStory("[ENTER SHEET STORY NAME HERE]", "18UsYDlaHZrCuIUt9FOMiU6zP7se5EVXjsHgttUDXzIs");</strong>. In that <strong>[ENTER SHEET STORY NAME HERE]</strong> area, paste in the name you gave your sheet in the Google Sheets document. After that, you can hit "Commit changes".</div>
    <div class="body-text">Finally, any images you may have used in your story, you will need to upload them into the folder.</div>
    <div style="width:800px;" class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="800px" src="images/29.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">In the folder that has your index.html file, click on "Add file", then "Upload file". Choose the image you need to upload. After that, you should be done. Your site can be found at "https://bcnnofficial.github.io/stories/[file name]/".</div>
	<div class="med-header">FOR A TOPIC PAGE</div>
    <div class="body-text">You will need access to the BCNN github page for the following. If you do not have access, please contact the Writing Assistance Office.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Within the "topics" folder, there should be another folder called "template", with a file in it called "index.html". Open that file and copy all of the text inside of it.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/30.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Next, go back to the topics folder. While inside of this folder, click on "Add file" in the top-right corner, then click on "Create new file".</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/31.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">At the top, you will be asked to add a name for the file. Your file name will be "[name of folder]/index.html".</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/32.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">In this case, I typed in "sample/index.html". This makes a folder inside of the "directories" folder, and creates the index.html file inside of that folder. You can name the folder whatever you want, but keep in mind that whatever you name that folder, it will become part of the page URL. For example, this story will have the link "https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/sample/". You create the folder when you type in the forward slash. Keep in mind the file name must be index.html, or the site won't work.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Next, paste in all the code from the template.</div>
    <div style="width:800px;" class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="800px" src="images/33.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">When you first paste it in, under &lt;script&gt;, it should read <strong>GenerateTopic("[ENTER TOPIC SHEET NAME HERE]", "1hVT3Q3RC_oM9nCJ3mKtcud53qSeJvIbZgvG-r7C3piM");</strong>. In that <strong>[ENTER TOPIC SHEET NAME HERE]</strong> area, paste in the name you gave your sheet in the Google Sheets document. After that, you can hit "Commit changes".</div>
    <div class="body-text">CORRECTION: Where it says <strong>FillWithStories("phillip-stories","Phillip Ball");</strong>, "Phillip Ball needs to be changed to the name of the sheet which has all stories of a topic (BCNN-stories sheet). Most likely, change "Phillip Ball" to the not-all-caps name of the topic. If this isn't fixed then no stories will appear under "CHECK OUT STORIES RELATED TO EARTH-1"</div>
    <div class="body-text">Finally, any images you may have used in your story, you will need to upload them into the folder.</div>
    <div style="width:800px;" class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="800px" src="images/34.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">In the folder that has your index.html file, click on "Add file", then "Upload file". Choose the image you need to upload. After that, you should be done. Your site can be found at "https://bcnnofficial.github.io/topics/[file name]/".</div>
    <div class="body-text">If at this point, you are able to access the page, and everything looks good to you, we can move to the final step to fully integrate your story or topic into the BCNN mainframe framework work system.</div>
    <div class="main-header">STEP 4: ADD INFO TO OTHER GOOGLE SHEETS</div>
    <div class="body-text">While everything may be done with your story, there are some last things to do. Once a story is fully integrated, it can appear on the topic pages it's associated with. It can appear at the bottom of the page as a suggested story. And it can appear other places.</div>
    <div class="body-text">What needs to be done depends on whether you have written a story or a topic page. Follow the directions as necessary.</div>
    <div class="body-text"><strong>But before we begin</strong>, you'll be asked in both sections to provide image links. The process for this is slightly different than before. Since the image won't always be in the same folder compared to where it's being used, you will need to grab a universal link.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/35.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">First, find the image in your folder containing the index.html file. Click on it to open the image in github.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/36.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Right-click on the image, and select the "Copy image address" option. You now have a link to the image that can be used from anywhere on the page.</div>
    <div class="med-header">FOR A STORY</div>
    <div class="body-text">You will have to complete the following process on multiple sheets. To access these sheets, click <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fWIH-9n4cbj2R6sSWUmsjCw2d00Ues2_jRdMAToMFZk/edit?gid=0#gid=0'>here</a>.</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/37.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text"></div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/38.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">First, you'll have to add your story to the "All" sheet no matter what. This is where all stories are kept. You will also have to add your story to any topics it is part of, as well as to any "story collections" (the sheets with the really long names). If you want to make your own story collection, that process will be demonstrated at the end of this section.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Regardless of what sheet you have access to, it should look like something from the image below:</div>
    <div class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="500px" src="images/39.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Similar to before, if you are adding a new story, you'll have to increment the number under "id".</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under "name", paste in the title of your story.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under "img_link", paste the universal link to the image you want to appear in thumbnails for the story.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under "date", paste in the date of publication.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under "first_paragraph", paste in the entire first paragraph from your story.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under "link", paste in the link to your story.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under "disclaimer", paste in any disclaimer associated with the image, like if it is AI generated or whatever.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under "alt", paste in the alt description for the image.</div>
    <div class="body-text">You do not need to worry about any of the other columns. If everything goes according to plan, your story should now be findable in all the right places.</div>
    <div class="body-text">The below content is if you want to make your own story collection. "Story collections" are collections of stories that have a similar subject, and they are found on the "Need to Know" page (<a href='https://bcnnofficial.github.io/need-to-know/'>link</a>). If you are making stories that are all about a similar subject and you want to organize all your stories into one place, then this might be helpful.</div>
    <div class="body-text">To add a story collection, you need to access <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pXrpCHUi0JTAlExJ_Q13ORWu43PD86J55TAPj7v5NAU/edit?gid=0#gid=0'>this</a> Google Sheets document.</div>
    <div style="width:800px;" class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="800px" src="images/40.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Add the next highest number under "id".</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under "name", add the name you want to appear for your story collection.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under "description", provide a brief description of what your story collection covers.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under "color", provide the color of the box you want all the info to appear in. There is a provided link that has a list of color accepted by the system. You can also provide a hexidecial value in the form of #xxxxxx. You can seach "color picker" on Google and it will provide you with a tool that lets you pick a color and find its hex value.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under "topic", give some keyword or keywords connected by hyphens that relate to your story collection.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Now, go back to the story Google Sheets page (<a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fWIH-9n4cbj2R6sSWUmsjCw2d00Ues2_jRdMAToMFZk/edit?gid=1786946738#gid=1786946738'>link</a>), and add a new sheet by clicking the plus icon in the bottom right. Let the name of this sheet be the name of the story collection.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Design the first row to match how it does below:</div>
    <div style="width:800px;" class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="800px" src="images/41.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Have the first row contain "name", "img_link", "date", "first_paragraph", "link", "disclaimer", "alt", and "topic". Under "topic", type in the keyword or keywords you came up with previously in the story collection sheet.</div>
    <div class="body-text">At this point, your story collection should appear as it's supposed to in the Need to Know page. You can add stories into it now.</div>
    <div class="med-header">FOR A TOPIC PAGE</div>
    <div class="body-text">First, you will need to access the topics Google Sheets page (<a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fz7QJy7ek0xH8D8HoGACmjHoJnMUdFG4tZhfIO_onag/edit?gid=0#gid=0'>link</a>).</div>
    <div style="width:800px;" class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="800px" src="images/42.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Under "id", add the next highest number.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under "name", add the name of the topic (customarially not in all caps, however this does not have to be the case).</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under "img_link", add the universal link to the image you want associated with your topic.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under "link", add the link to the topic page.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under "disclaimer", add any disclaimer associated with the image, like if it is AI generated or whatever.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under "first_paragraph", paste in the whole first paragraph from your topic page.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under "color", add the color of box you want your material to appear in when searched for on the topic searching page. <a href='https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Properties/color/keywords'>This link</a> provides a list of words you can enter that are associated with colors, however you can also enter a hexidecial value for your color in the format #xxxxxx. <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker&oq=color+p&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqDggAEEUYJxg7GIAEGIoFMg4IABBFGCcYOxiABBiKBTIGCAEQRRg5MgoIAhAAGLEDGIAEMgwIAxAAGBQYhwIYgAQyBwgEEAAYgAQyCggFEAAYsQMYgAQyBggGEEUYPDIGCAcQBRhA0gEIMTgxOGowajSoAgCwAgE&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8'>This link</a> will provide you with a color picker that can give you the hex value of whatever color.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under "finder", enter some keyword or keywords connected with a hyphen you want associated with the topic.</div>
    <div class="body-text">The last step is to create a new sheet on the stories Google Sheets page (<a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fz7QJy7ek0xH8D8HoGACmjHoJnMUdFG4tZhfIO_onag/edit?gid=0#gid=0'>link</a>).</div>
    <div style="width:800px;" class="guide-image-container"><img class="guide-image" width="800px" src="images/43.png"></div>
    <div class="body-text">Click the plus sign in the bottom left to create a new sheet. Make sure this name matches whatever you chose for the name on the topics Google Sheets document.</div>
    <div class="body-text">Make sure your top row matches what is above, with "id", "name", "img_link", "date", "first_paragraph", "link", "disclaimer", "alt", "topic", and "finder".</div>
    <div class="body-text">Under "topic", paste in the name of the sheet, which should be the name chosen for the topic on the topics Google Sheets page. For "finder", paste in whatever you chose for "finder" on the topics Google Sheets page.</div>
    <div class="main-header">YOU ARE DONE</div>
    <div style='margin-bottom: 500px;'class="body-text">Here at BCNN, we know this is a lot of information to keep track of.
