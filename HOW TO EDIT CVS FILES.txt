Ok here's the deal
So .cvs files are essentially just text files. Each line represents a different row, and cells within a row are separated by commas.
If the content of the cell has a comma (for example, in the first paragraph cell, the paragraph will probably contain commas), then surround the content in parentheses
So to add a new story to a .cvs file, first (on a new line) add the number of the story, then without spaces add a comma and paste in the article title.
If the article title has a comma in it, surround the article title in parentheses. Again without spaces place a comma and paste in the link to the fiest image as it's referenced in the html file
Then another comma and in parentheses (unless your first paragraph has no commas) paste the first paragraph
